    "I like that you can see through the bag, and it's nicer than the clear plastic bags you normally would find. I use it to keep medications organized and easy to locate within a large tote. It is attractive, and is of a nice, solid construction. Worth the price (~$8).",
    "I have purchased two of these so far, they break really easy if you do not close the lid just right. The igloo cooler is top notch but the latch, they need to go back to the drawing board",

    "Absolutely horrible product! Messy can't even begin to describe what you'll have. Product does take longer to warm than on instructions and the paddle is useless. Eyebrow guides aren't worth the paper they're on, and upon attempting to use, this went right into the trash. Don't waste your money!",
    "I guess most people would use a drill press cross vice for their drill press. I decided to buy the parrot vice and adapt it to my drill press because my press is radical and has many ways to make adjustments. The parrot vice is somewhat unique and I bolted to my drill table and turned it on its side to get more room between the bit and the vice. I would recommed this as a vice I don't think you should hammer on the jaws but it is a good lighter duty vice and it would be good to also use for woodworking.",

    "I don't know what took me so long to buy this! I used to get the cheapo's from WalMart. NEVER AGAIN! There is such a difference! My hair actually feels soft and silky after straightening it. I have fine, thin hair with a bit of a wave and without this flat iron, it just looks terrible. The CHI heats up instantly and is very easy to use. It is definitely worth it!",
    "I found this perfume completely by accident and fell in love with it, as did my boyfriend. It's a little pricier than many other perfumes but well worth it. I only wear it for special occasions and wearing the perfume makes it even more special. Even my kids noticed it when I wore it!",

    "I bought this with the intention of learning how to carve rubber stamps. Although I haven't gotten to spend too much time trying to learn this craft, I will say that this stuff carves really smoothly. There is the issue of the ends not being level due to the cutting process at the factory so there is an 1/4\" border that is unusable.",
    "This is great for sealing molding after painting for a professional, finished look. Unfortunately, my local hardware stores have stopped supplying it in the store.

    "This is a cheap violin in every sense of the word... both inexpensive and low quality.That said, I didn't want to spend the money on a violin if it turns out I won't play it any more than I did as a kid.Given its price and my questionable commitment this is a great bargain - I didn't need to spend any more than the price of the violin because it comes with literally everything but the music. It had the case, two bows, rosin, extra strings, extra bridge, metronome/tuner, and shoulder rest.As for what makes it a low quality violin -* The pegs do slip. It is hard to get it to stay tuned (okay, it was hard to tune it in the first place!)* The fine tuner was broken (the pin didn't connect to the tuner for the E string and the pin head broke)* The tuner didn't come with any useful directions. Minimal ones to get to the instrument, but not really helpful from a usefulness perspective.* The sound quality is awful to low end mediocre. I plan to replace the strings since I have to get the fine tuner repaired.As regards other reviews as well as helpful tips -* Some reviews indicate that they needed to install the bridge. Mine came with the bridge installed* The bow will work to pull out sound but you need to tighten it (turn the knob at the end of the bow) and you need a LOT of rosin. I remembered this from playing as a kid though. You do need to get the rosin surface scratched so that it will stick to the bow. And you need a LOT. When you think you've got enough put on that much 2X over.* The shoulder rest probably shouldn't change the sound... but it does (though that may well be just due to the peg slippage as you get the shoulder rest attached) so if you plan to use the shoulder rest make sure it's attached when you tune the violin.My plan is to take this to get the strings replaced, the fine tuner fixed, and the violin tuned. I'll update the post after I get these things done.Keep in mind though that this review, along with all of the other four and five star reviews, is relative to the price. If I'd paid list this would be a one or two star violin. If you're expecting a Stradivarius for this price you should adjust your expectations down several dozen notches - this is to a Stradivarius what the last place t-ball team is to the world champion major league baseball team.For an adult who is not sure of their level of commitment this is an ideal purchase. I wouldn't purchase it for a child who is still learning - there is too much downside. I agree with other posters who say to rent the kids a decent violin.In summary - you get what you pay for but you do get everything you need.",
    "I bought this to hold my whiteboard up, and sure it does indeed do so. However, if I apply just a little less than baby pressure, the locks that hold the white board up loosen and the whole thing falls. It happens quite a bit, but personally I've learned to be very sensitive with it.",
    "This is a very gentle yet effective way to exfoliate skin with absolutely no damaging abrasiveness.The consistency of the product is grainy rather than heavy with hard granules. Some other exfoliators have been simply too harsh, so that when I rub for the stated amount of time it almost feels like I'm rubbing pebbles into my skin.Micro is the operative word here - it soothes and smooths at the same time",
    "Well made, not super heavy duty, but will do the job I bought them for, specifically tree felling and other chores around the homestead. Worth the price and I expect them to last for quite a long time. Which is why I bought two of these. The fact that they are made in the US played an important part of the decision.",
    "I paid ~$4 for this product. Over many years, I have used tons of this product to.....1) Attach rather heavy metal/plastic surge protectors to walls2) Secure a rechargeable mouse base to a wood desk3) Stick a plastic USB hub to a plastic desk4) Hold a plastic motion detector light ~7 feet over one of my desks - On a wall5) Secure various wires that are frequently used6) On various other objects around my house* Before applying to any surface, I sanitize the surface and let the area dry. Then, I stick the Velcro on and make sure it has thoroughly adhered. Lastly, I stick the objects together and do not move them for hours. This procedure and product only failed when I did not use enough Velcro. This item is like double back tape, but more useful.",
    "These are just perfect ... Reading the earlier reviews I was just hoping that I get all of them :) When I saw the package, there was no way anything could come out. Besides they were in a sealed plastic pack so I was really happy. Just thought I did write this review to let others know that the packaging is perfect now!",
    "I've had this lamp for a few years now. It's very handy to have around in a power outage, and it's been camping with me at least 4 or 5 times. It's so handy while trying to put up a tent in the dark. The light output is pretty good and adjustable, and it will use rechargeable batteries, which are an good investment. Even though it is plastic, I've had no problems with anything breaking on it.",
    "This is a considerable improvement over what I was using before - I do feel like I have to reapply the rosin a lot more frequently though. Also, it doesn't seem as &#34;dust free&#34; as I thought it would be. After each practice I still have to wipe off a good bit of rosin from under the strings and from the edge of the fingerboard. It also likes to cake onto the strings, so I wind up doing a bit of scraping after I play. Still, I would recommend it.",
    "This product lives up to its claims. I am 58 years old with normal/oily skin. I have no blemishes or discoloration. My oily t-zone no longer has breakouts. I tend to have enlarged pores that easily get clogged and cause pimples. My pores are visibly smaller giving my skin a firmer look and I don't get pimples anymore. My drier cheek area feels nicely moisturized. One of my favorite things about this product is I feel like I'm getting the same results as many of the expensive department store lines, but at a much better price. I wash my face with Olay Cleanser and during these very cold winter months I also dab on a little Olay Lotion for an extra layer of protection against the elements. That is the total regimen. Simple, easy, good results. The icing on the cake is that I ordered this Auto-Delivery. When the price of the product dropped in the stores Amazon dropped my Auto-Delivery price. If you've ever ordered Auto-Delivery you know that most places will always charge the same price as the initial order, so that was a pleasant surprise.",
    "Here's a follow up after less than one year's use:(since receipt of the bike, i have changed every part besides the seat post and the bolts that hold the bike together.)Up until last night, i had not complaints about the bike besides the fact that the hangers broke often. But atleast hangers can be replaced. Last night I went out for a ride and was skidding around corners for fun when the frame snapped just after the weld on the left chainstay that binds the chainstay tube to the solid dropouts. It wasn't a defect in the welding, the tube itself snapped.To be honest i have gotten a lot of use from this bike in the few months i've ridden it. It will do justice to most trails and riders but beware that catastrophic frame failure may be around the next corner.Another thing to note: after I bought this bike, my friends also bought 2 of them, they ARE slightly different in measurements and components. The newer version will not fit an 8 inch rear shock.Following is my initial review of the bike:I'll start by saying the bike came in one day and in good condition. The headset on the bike is a little strange, there's a little peice at the bottom that prevents you from mounting a standard fender on the front wheel. I ride this bike hard taking 3-4 ft vertical drops and flying at curb sides and I have had just a few issues. First off, I have dented the rims and have since upgraded them. The stock rims were very light and they would be very durable under normal riding. Second I was oiling the hubs and accidentially got some oil on the disc rotors, they were terrible at stopping for a long time after that (so be careful!). Also brake pads for the stock brakes are hard to find. I have since upgraded to Avid bb7 mechanical disc brakes with a 203mm rotor on the front and back and it works great. Pads are much easier to find and stopping power is amazing. The only thing is that the front fork tends to flex under extreme braking and it's a little unnerving. The rear shock is a little bouncy but there's nothing wrong with it. I have since upgraded to a Xfuxion 02 RC air shock with lock out and it works very well, but this is personal preferance. The sides of the saddle wear pretty quickly but it doesn't need to be replace. It's a little wide if you're doing downhill riding but I think i'll keep it. I've had this bike for two weeks and the rear tires are almost completely worn but it really depends on the type of riding you do. They also don't inspire confidence when doing highspeed cornering or stopping on cement The front shock is a bit soft for me, i'm 165 lbs, but the sag helps keep high speed traction over rough stuff so i suppose it worked out. The gear ratios are very comprehensive although top end speed is a little low for me but that's because I usually ride road bikes. Low end gearing will get you up any hill with the right tires and rear shocks. The pedals are plastic, i don't care, they get torn up anyways. Personally i don't like grip shifters because you have to shift your hand's position while riding to shift gears and if you're hitting some rough stuff or jumping over something, your wrists take a beating.Overall a great bike, i would reccomend it to my best friend. Don't take anything I said too critically because I'm picking apart very small issues. It's a great deal for the price, they don't waste money on components so you can customize it yourself. This bike is highly upgradable and user friendly, unless you're coming from high end $1000+ bikes, this bike will not dissapoint. 250 is a steal.",
    "Concept is good, but quality is poor, and customer service has been poor so far as well. Straps began to fall apart almost immediately. Contacted customer service over a month ago, and they said they would send a replacement. Have not recieved a replacement, or a response to my subsequent email. I would advise anyone considering this product to steer clear.UPDATE: Eight months have gone by since my initial review. They still have not provided either a replacement or a refund. I strongly recommend that you don't buy this or any other Gofit product - odds are you'll only regret it.",

Besides, the smell is gone after you rinse your hair.",

    "My family no longer uses another product ever since we discovered Cetaphil. After our toddler was diagnosed with Eczema, we found that Aquaphor was either not doing much good or was really being downright harmful. During one of the desperate night-time itching episodes, I slathered on some Cetaphil Cream instead of Aquaphor. The itching immediately went down. Surprised, I started investigating and found some not so great information about Aquaphor.At least in our case, Cetaphil cream (NOT the lotion - thats too weak)in combination with a heavy moisturizer, worked wonders for our toddlers eczema. The national eczema association also rates it well but not as highly simply because of the presence of almond oil, a potential allergen (Not a problem with our toddler).We first apply Cetaphil cream, wait for it to be absorbed and then apply a film of Theraplex emollient (the one that is thick and waxy and comes in a tub). This was worked miracles for our child. To learn more, you can try looking up my review of Theraplex emollient.",
    "I bought this to replace a Brother machine that failed after 15 years. This machine's embroidery is superior to my old machine. More stitches and the stitches are rendered better. The action is smooth (but it's the noisiest machine I've ever had). I was pleasantly surprised with the construction of the machine, I was expecting cheap construction for such an inexpensive machine.There are a few bad features. The machine is not very responsive to the presser foot. I'm used to a machine stopping and starting directly with the presser foot. This machine goes a few stitches after the pressure is completely off the foot. And the needle always returns to the up position, so every time you need to turn a corner or do something where the needle must be down, you have to manually crank it a half stitch. The 'reverse' button is in a awkward place and there is a really annoying 'needle threader' that hangs directly to the right of the needle. This can't be removed or moved off to the side, so it just hangs in your way. It would have been a much better design to just include a cheap little threader in the storage box for the people who can't thread a needle by hand.",
    "I bought this bike as cheap starter to see if I'd actually ride it on a regular basis and I definitely got what I paid for. It worked fine for about a month (just long enough for it to be outside of the return period) and then one thing after another started to break. After daily 30 minute use, the bearing slowly started to squeak, the flywheel started tapping the magnet, and after about three months the belt completely disintegrated and broke. This thing is a piece of garbage and not worth your money. There is no support or warranty for it other than Amazon and you'll never get in touch with the manufacturer. I would only recommend it to those that want to find out if they're serious about riding before getting a better bike. Any normal user should stay as far away as possible and spend the extra $100 to get a nice bike like the Schwinn 120.I'd love to give this 0 stars, the fact that it has an average of 4 is ridiculous. Look through the user reviews and you will find plenty more like this one.",

    "The Crop In Style XXL Rolling Tote is excellent for storing my origami supplies. When I teach, a lot of my time is spent planning, loading, and transporting supplies; when I get home from class, more time is spent putting things away. Now all of my supplies are in one place and easily transported from home to class. I have more time and energy for folding and teaching. Though it is heavy when fully loaded, the tote rolls easily, and feels sturdy and secure. Strong handles on the sides allow you to lift the tote from floor to table. If I could change one thing, I would make the interior a bright color such as yellow or red, so that any items at the bottom of the tote could be seen more easily. Even so, this is an excellent item, and a good value at the price offered at Amazon.",

There is also a dvd that shows how to do it, but I just followed the threads and was able to thread it on my first try in under 30 minutes. It works really well too. The only thing bad is the little trimming tray is hard to attach and too small. It has yet to yam on me or break thread since I re-threaded it.",
    "At only a little more than a dollar a pair, you really can't go wrong here, especially when if you get caught during the wrong part of a supplies sale and end up having to buy the expensive pair at like $5. They cut as well as to be expected with kid scissors, but don't expect to be able to carry it around in the box. It's very flimsy and arrived to us nearly busting open, so you'll probably need a small plastic supplies case to store them in properly. A great bargain.",

I thought I could get by with a cheap replacement,Singer Seam Ripper 4-Inch with Ball and Cover, but unfortunately I got what I paid for. It wouldn't cut a fine hair if it tried and believe me I tried! I had to throw it away and start looking again. I came across this seam ripper and took a chance. I am very pleased with it's performance and quality. I have to cut through upholstery thread and this seam ripper slices through the thick threads and tight stitches like a hot knife through butter. It is much larger than your typical seam ripper, so be aware of that(it's 5 1/2\" long). If you don't mind working with a larger seam ripper then this is definitely worth buying.",

    "Creamy, long lasting lipstick that feels great on. I am surprised by the quality. What is a plus about these is that they are not greasy or slippery. They have no bad taste which is very important to me and even after drinking from a can, my lips still feel very moisturized and my lipstick still looks good.I am very happy with these colors. I tried them out at Ulta. I wanted to like Cinnabar, but it just didn't do right with my skin tone and was just a tiny bit on the orange side on me, anyway (The screen colors are way off). Some spicy colors will do that, so it's best to try before you buy. Mauve Quartz is a toned down neutral pink on me. It is very natural looking and an everyday, casual color. It is a nice color to brighten my look on those days when I don't want to wear makeup. Moonlit Pearl is a little deeper pink brown, but doesn't go on bright. The brown tones it down and it would go better with a made up face. Another pretty color is Iced Topaz. I held off on buying it for now because it is a bit frosty and I have a similar color that is not quite as frosty from Revlon called Caramel Glace. Revlon and Maybelleine's baseline lipsticks are excellent and for less than five dollars at Walmart, there are some good alternatives. But, Pur Minerals has a very good lipstick at a decent price, and with shea butter as the second ingredient you really can't beat the quality at that good of a price.I recently purchased Black Amethyst after seeing it on a tutorial online. It looks very dark and deep. For some reason, it looks more like a cherry red on me leaning towards fuchsia. A little disappointed. I'm not sure if i can return it or not.",

    "I purchased these shoes as a barefoot alternative/minimalist shoe as I am very much a believer in this movement. I have many barefoot shoes ranging from the vibram fivefingers to multiple vivobarefoots. I wear nothing but minimalist shoes and study the topic regularly (see the Harvard Barefoot Running website for a good overview).These shoes are probably a step between a regular running shoe and a barefoot shoe. If you would like to switch to barefoot, but are afraid of moving directly to something like the fivefingers, these shoes would probably work very well for you. They do not have any arch support, which is excellent. They do have a fair amount of sole, however, which prevents you from truly feeling the ground and moving with the appropriate barefoot gait.I do not want to seem like I do not like these shoes though, as they do have some desirable assets. For one, they do have a very minimal upper, which does not restrict movement. The sole is also very flexible, albeit slightly rounded. At first the rounded sole seems a bit strange, but it will work your gluteus medius/minimus more than a normal shoe and should help with balance and ankle strength. These shoes are also very light, and the sizing for me was the same as any other minimalist shoe.Also, you cant beat the price. Although they are not true barefoot type shoes as some other reviewers mention, if you dont have 150 bucks to drop on vivobarefoot (best barefoot shoes on the market) or dont like the look of the fivefingers (they are amazingly comfortable however only losing points for not being appropriate for every occasion) these may be a good start for you.Finally, these shoes are way better than the Nike Free shoes (any version of them) but I would put them in a similar class of minimalist shoe. If you are wondering what these will feel like, go try on some Nike Free 3.0 shoes. These have a similar feel outside of the rounded sole. These shoes also have a flat feel, where the Nike Free's have a slightly raised heel.Enjoy getting rid of all of your back pain through ditching the foot cast that is today's running shoe.",

    "Having used Olay Regenerist Regenerating Lotion with UV Protection before, I was looking for a source less expensive than local drug stores. This fluid helps smooth fine wrinkles and moisturizes my skin, especially after prolonged exposure to the elements or to the dryness of indoor environments during the winter. The UV protection is an added bonus, for it helps protect my Celtic complexion from sun damage which has, in the past, led to actinic keratoses on my face and arms. The fluid is well absorbed without being sticky and has no strong after-scent of perfume. Cost on Amazon was considerably less than I paid for it in the past at a chain pharmacy known for low prices. Ordering was simple and well co-ordinated. The purchase was shipped promptly and received within the designated time frame--fully intact and ready to use.",

    "These will wear out........soon.The tips of the fingers wear out faster than I you'd expect on these gloves. They should make the finger tip material more durable, but that might hinder the good dexterity that these gloves have. And the fit is better than most.I also like that the palm is free of needless layers of \"protection\" and cushiony stuff. The grip panels on other gloves actually make it harder to get a good tight grip on tools and handles. A thin clutter free palm is best.The cuff is also too short........my wrist bone sicks out just above the edge of the cuff, just another 1/2 inch would make a difference, but another inch of cuff would be a great addition to this standard line of gloves.I like the all black/monotone......the big white logo version is too gimmicky.",

    "This is the first time I've ever owned a mountain bike and the first time I ever used a Trunk Mount Rack. I have 98 Acura RL.This rack is sturdy (all metal parts), strong, and very easy to use. I admit, I was nervous the first time I used it. I kept looking in my rear view to see if the bike was flopping around or had fallen off or whatever ;) I was extremely surprised how well it held the bike in place, even over bumps in the road.This rack is worth every penny and easily fits in my trunk when I'm not using it.I highly recommend you read the other reviews and look at the pictures on how to secure the bike to the car, keep the front tire from moving, put socks on the pedals if you need to, etc. All that information was EXTREMELY helpful.You might want these bungee cords: Highland 90086 Bungee Cord Assortment - Set of 12",

    "Originally, I had to return it because the 75-pen/pencil caddy was torn 5\" along a seam. The Amazon customer service person was great, & even though I had to return the whole item (no cost to me), I received the replacement in time for my crop.Regarding the pen caddy, it has its own pocket in the tote, & it can be reverse folded to stand on the crop table - very handy for pen viewing & access.I don't use the interior compartments. I remove them to make room for my items, which are already self-contained & too tall for my other totes.The height of the tote is especially important to me. Other totes are too short to carry some of my containers, etc. Plus, it makes a great stand for paper, etc. when your table area is limited.The front outer compartment has plenty of room for cutting mats, scoring board, etc., plus clear, Velcro pockets to hold smaller items. Then the side pockets are also user friendly.The telescoping handle is very helpful, which is even more important when a tote like this can get very heavy when loaded.If I knew that this tote would last for more than just a couple of years, I'd rate it 5 stars, but it's still new & too soon to tell.",

    "I bought this as a second, backup light to complement my main headlight, a 3W LED light. This light uses a single low power white LED powered by two AA batteries. The light has a very tight focus and can be set to flash, or be constantly on. I haven't tested the runtime, but it should be in the order of 100 hours.I fully understand that a single 5mm LED will only put out so much light, so I was hoping this could help others see me, not necessarily help me see the road. Unfortunately Cateye made the beam VERY narrow, which is NOT what you want for a \"to be seen\" light. It's WAY too dim to serve as a headlight but the beam is WAY too narrow to help others see you - unless it's pointed directly into their eyes. I know this will sound harsh, but this light isn't good for anything. If you want an LED headlight, spend the extra $15 or so to get the Cateye HL-EL530 or the Planet Bike 1W Super Spot (which I also reviewed). Both of them have a VASTLY brighter, 1W LED which actually puts out enough light to be useful as a headlight at night.",
    "Ernie Ball 6102 Amplifier Pop Out Casters :Ernie Ball 6102 Amplifier Casters Pop OutI had bought a new Fender Hot Rod Deluxe III tube amp about 6 months ago. I had always wished it came with casters. It's a bit of a heavy beast to carry around. Now that I've installed my new Ernie Ball 6102 Amplifier Pop Out Casters it makes lugging the amp a bit more tolerable. I love that when the casters are popped out, the caster bushing is lower than the amps rubberized feet. So stacking and stability are still there on stage or off with the casters removed.Installing the casters was a little nerve wracking. But drilling into a pristine piece of equipment can put anyone on edge. Wish there was a template for drilling. But all in all it was an easy job. Took me maybe 20-30 minutes to install myself.My only gripe was there were no screws packaged with the casters, even though they are shown in the photo here on Amazon. My instance may have been a fluke. But that's okay. Trip to he hardware store solved that problem. Plus I knew the screws were long enough not to come through the inside of the amp case, and thick enough to handle the torque from being used.All in all I'd highly recommend the Ernie Ball 6102 Amplifier Pop Out Casters. It's a good product at a great price.",

Also, the middle part of the pick is so thin that it can easily break the whole pick into two pieces.",
    "Great fit, nice features, including the drain in the back that works automatically. One reviewer mentioned that the tall heel tabs cause irritation, and I agree. Just cut them off, as the boots are real easy to get on and off anyway. I like that these have a somewhat narrow and slender profile, as they make getting on my medium sized Blades easier. My thick 7mm ones make it hard to get the fins on all the way. Also, the rubber extended toe caps and on the heel are great.I completely recommend these boots. Better than my older Akona's by far.",

    "This beautiful, responsive turntable is suited for hiphop DJs and other experienced users of high end turntable, not so much for the casual listener like myself perhaps. It starts and stops instantly, since it is belt less, and has a few incomprehensible controls that seem to be catering to the needs of scratchers and mixers that are entirely superfluous for the player of music to enjoy music. It sounds nice, especially since I bought a decent cartridge to replace the stock DJ-style cartridge it comes with.Replacing a cartridge is difficult, requiring tiny wires to be wrenched out of tight connections, and then jammed back in. I had to use a needle nose pliers to remove some of them. Tiny screws need to be removed and replaced, and they are easy to lose. There is a 2 gram weight screwed into the top of the cartridge carrier that I still haven't really understood, about which I'll say more in the setup problems I found.Setting up this turntable seemed to be almost impossible, if one follows the vague, almost incomprehensible instructions they provide. There is a separate weight that needs to be installed on the end of the tone arm. Fine. But it slides on the tone arm and can be positioned almost randomly anywhere, without any indication I could see or feel as to where it needs to be positioned.I spent days trying to figure out where they expected this weight to be positioned. In one positions, the needle would go straight upward, in another, it went down. Finding the position that allowed it to float freely, neither up or down, was impossible until I removed the 2 gram weight. Once I balance it, I was able to reinstall the weight and make all the calculations about how heavy I wanted my weight to be - I simply guessed than between 2.5 and 3 grams would be sufficient.I think I adjusted the anti-skate correctly, but am still unsure. What I realized is that the manufacturer of this turntable has no interest in providing any guidance for anyone interested in any use for this turntable but scratching and mixing records. This is probably why you can't turn the damn thing off all the way unless you dig around deep behind it to a very well hidden switch, which, if you don't keep your turntable on anything but a surface where it is easy to reach around the back and under it, you will never turn it off as long as you own it.If I were sophisticated enough to judge the sound quality, I would weigh in on it, but I feel like I bought the wrong turntable for my needs.",

    "My husband and I purchased this tent to upgrade ourselves to go camping with our son - now 2 1/2. The tent is very easy to set, well built and was exactly what we needed. A nice sized sleeping room and a bug free living space (we live and camp in Florida).We have not sealed the seems, they don't seem to need it. It rained one night, not a drop inside the tent. Everything in the tent is well thought out (with the exception that we would have liked the e-port in the front room instead of the back room). We love the way the windows work and how well ventilated the tent is.Having a front and back room door also worked well.The only complaint - if it can even be called that - is we couldn't seem to really get the front fly to stand properly. It sagged no matter how we put it together and in the morning was covered in a lot of dew, so if we left by the front door, lots of droplets came raining down on us. This pictures show those poles being a lot taller then they seem to be for our tent.Take down is as easy as the set up was and if you follow the instructions, you should have no problem getting the tent back in the bag.Well worth it, we are very excited to own this product and it made our latest camping trip such a joy that we are actively researching other places we can go camping. So, a good tent.",
    "I've had seborrheic dermatitis since I was a child. Sometimes it would affect most of my head but sometimes just the right or the left side of it. With this thing being hidden by my hair and by barely having itching, I never really took an action to cleanup the mess above my brain.I'm 25 now and I decided I'd do something about it and try getting rid of it once for all.First thing I did was coming to god AMAZON and looking for something that would help me accomplish that. This product came into my attention mainly because of its positive reviews. Even though most of the people say they are using it to successfully treat psoriasis, I decided to give it a shot.Before using it for the first time, I had the seborrhea and some dandruff only on the right side of my head and I was also having some itching mostly in the afternoons. Eventually I'd notice flakes on my office table and on my shoulders. I wash my hair in the morning and at night (around 1 hour before going to bed) and started using this product on the affected area right after my morning shower.In the third day of usage, the itching ran away completely and my head was a little bit red colored in the area where I applied the product.One week after I started using it (once a day), my head was completely clean and free from itching. Since then, I started using the product around 3 times a week at maximum and it had kept my head clean as new.No itching. No Flakes. No dandruff. Nothing! This product is simply amazing!!

Seems anyone with a 9 volt battery could get into the safe any time. We are thinking about disabling this feature by cutting the wire to avoid unauthorized entry. We will just need to make sure we know where the keys are if the batteries for the electronic lock go dead! I think overall the product offered by Gun Vault is a bit better made, but the price (and free shipping) made these ADG safes the best available for the cost.",

The original turbo is quite a bit heavier than this ball and throws a much better spiral. To get this Poof to throw a tight spiral you have to use your wrist instead of your arm. It also \"quacks\" if you try and throw it long distances. It is a decent attempt at replicating the classic Nerf Turbo but ultimately falls short in several areas.",

    "I purchased a 4 oz. bottle at my local hardware chain store. I used it for two repairs at one sitting. It did not hold a slightly separated sole on a pair of sneakers. I thought this would be a simple job but the \"gorilla\" was more like a little pet monkey. However, the glue did work well in the other repair. I understand that no product is made to perform its best on all surfaces so I give it an average grade for performance since my admittedly limited experience yielded 50/50 results.My problem lies in the extremely short shelf life. After just the one use described above, I sealed the bottle per the instructions by squeezing out all of the air before tightening the cap down. When I tried to use the bottle for another repair 2 months later, the entire contents had hardened. I called customer service and they told me I should repeat the same process of removing the air before tightly capping the bottle but this time, I should store the bottle upside down so that any possible hardening would remain at the bottom of the bottle and the useable glue would be accessible at the tip. Thinking this was a fluke, I bought another bottle but this time it was the 2 oz. size. It sat in the original box, upside down on my home office desk. When I needed it about 10 weeks later I opened it only to find another useless hardened mass. The factory seal had never even been broken yet Gorilla Glue had screwed me again.I reluctantly give it even a one star rating. I don't care how good the glue MAY be if it dries up so fast that you only get one use per bottle or in the case of my 2nd attempt NO USE AT ALL? Unless you plan to use the entire contents (or at least a good portion of it) within a couple of weeks of purchasing it AND at one sitting, don't waste your money!

I've taken it on location for working in the theatre, demonstrations,fashion shows, etc. It has been dropped(not by me), left on over night(again not by me,LOL)and banged around in my gear bag. My last one lasted for 3 years, however, another stylist borrowed it and it came back not working... I've decided this is the last time anyone uses my CHI, it's now under lock and key.I can't say enough about this product other than it is the best! The original (and buy the original 1\",the other functions on newer models detract from the performance) by Farouk has been voted the number one stylist's tool and number one straightening iron by The Stylist's Choice Awards for several years.Last but not least, average retail is $199, I was skeptical about buying one for less than my cost, but so far so good. I was amazed at the price and had a replacement for the one that was broken within three days.Make sure to try Farouk Silk Infusion or BioSilk Therapy when blow drying and run a drop over your hair when straightening...it will protect your hair, smooth away any fly aways and increase the shine!B.B. from Studio Be",

    "I just received this piano yesterday and I am thrilled! The two piano sound settings are some of the best I've heard (and I've read elsewhere that this piano and its bigger brother--the ProKeys 88--have the best sound for any piano under $1000). The keys feel great considering they are semi-weighted, and the multiple velocity settings are very well implemented.When purchasing this piano, there are some things to keep in mind that can add to the overall cost. Most importantly, this keyboard does not have built-in speakers, so you will need a separate set and some good cabling to get sound for everyone to hear. Otherwise, if listening through headphones suits your needs, you'll either need a pair with a 1/4\" connector or a 1/8 to 1/4\" adaptor if you want to use your MP3 player headphones. Fortunately, the piano does come with a USB cable and drivers, so you can use it as a MIDI device on your computer immediately. Finally, you may want to consider buying a keyboard cover in order to protect it from dust and the like.If you're looking for more reviews, Keyboard Magazine has the one that influenced me to buy this piano.

I was sewing with satin and a basic straight stitch when suddenly the bobbin housing popped out of the machine with such violent force that it broke the needle and jammed the satin so tightly into the machine that it had to be cut out of the machine. At first I thought it was because perhaps the bobbin was not loaded or because the tension was off and chalked it up to my excitement to rush into a new project on my hour old machine, however, after closer examination, two more needles, a yard of $95.00 satin and a half of a spool of thread, I learned that the housing which is made of flimsy plastic was split at the screw. The thread was getting caught in the split thus causing me to scrap my entire project, not to mention the time spent and emotional attatchment to my project... and now I am the disappointed owner of a useless machine. What a complete waste of time and expensive lesson this has been!",

    "Just got the tool today and it is junk! Did not work out of the box. Changed the battery like the instructions stated and the zeros on the display. Instruction stated to pull the cover, but nothing as to how to pull the cover without breaking it. This tool will be in the dumpster.",
    "I bought this for the wife who didn't want me to spend the money. Once she used it she was glad I did and she really likes it. It is incredibly quiet on the low setting. You can have a normal conversation it is so quiet. Easy to use and dries your hair reasonably quick. I also noticed the statement about the warranty being voided if not purchased from a hair salon. I hope I don't have to find out but I would think that is not legal to do. If they sell it to Amazon to resell then they should be required to honor the standard warranty. Whatever it is a great dryer that is quieter and should help prevent hearing loss. Definitely much cheaper than a high tech hearing aid. I am planning on buying two more for birthday presents for the daughters.",
    "Our grandkids love playing with this. Great quailty. Adults enjoy it as much as the kids do. Arrived on time and was just as advertised.",
    "The drill bits were an excellant buy. Finding this size locally was difficult but Amazon had them.",
    "You get what you pay for. This cologne was very cheap compared to others I've purchased. The bottle is plastic and is not one I would leave on my dresser. To be honest I kindof hide it in my medicine cabinet. The scent is nice though, very light and clean. I've been told it smells like I just stepped out of the shower, even hours after I put it on. I'd recommend this for younger people, ages 12-25. My little brother would probably like it. For reference, I'm 26 and would not buy this again for myself. I gave it 4 stars because it was so cheap and smells decent.",

    "I purchased this tape in both silver-white and blue versions, 2 in x 15 ft. This tape is very easy to cut to shape & size with a scissors, peel the backing off, and stick to items you want to be more visible at night. Adhesion is very strong.This material is prismatic retroreflective sheeting, which is superior to the older technology of tiny glass beads (like what you see in Scotchlite material). The older glass-beaded material is good, but this prismatic stuff is newer technology and is much brighter at night. It is made with tiny pyramid-shaped prisms manufactured into the sheeting that reflect light back to the source at night. Great for visibility to car drivers at night. Prismatic sheeting is the kind of material most states and cities are now specifying for brand-new highway signs these days.I am a bicycle commuter and wanted to enhance my low-light visibility for safety. I cut strips of this tape and applied them to my bike and my bicycle helmet. It worked out great. The silver-white is really bright when light shines on it at night. The blue is also quite visible, but not as loud as the white. My bike is primarily blue, so I used both blue and silver on it. Rolls of 2 in x 15 ft go a long way for this kind of project - I got my bike and helmet outlined like I wanted with the two rolls and still had leftover tape in both colors.",
    "Hair dryer works good. Thant said, the design of the handle could use some improvement. It has a narrow handle. Periodically, I accidentally turn off the hair dryer because my finger accidentally squeezes the small toggle on-off switch on the handle. It is a little annoying, but tolerable",

    "MSA makes these filters to go on their masks which keeps particulates out of your respiratory tract. The are three general levels of filtering: N95, R95 and P100. The latter keeps 99.97% of all particulate aerosols out. Notice that these are the P100's.Elsewhere on the 'net, you can find these filters for $3-$5 for a 2 pack. This pair costs over $5000. But I can tell the difference between these and the lower priced pair because I think they have aluminum foil or a plastic bag in them to keep any air from passing thru the filter. This keeps air and thus, any bad stuff from entering your lungs. You just have to take the mask off frequently to breathe. Make sure that you run to a safe place before you breathe tho.Additionally, these filters come with a welder in a gray sweatshirt and green suspenders to tackle any welding projects that you may have. He's most comfortable with metal tubing. Be advised that you have to supply the welding machine and rods.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. Just know that these filters don't last forever and you will have to replace them eventually. That goes for the welder, too.",
    "I will not be without one, I use it everyday. When a Friend lost my knife, the next day I reached for it 4 times, so you see, I really like having one.

    "This seems like a very well made mirror, it is a nice size, and the magnification strength is great. It is easy to install, and the nickel finish is very classy. The one thing, though, particularly after reading another reviewer's comment, is that I make a habit of tightening the screws on either side of the mirror from time to time ... just seems to make sense, considering that the mirror gets rotated back and forth quite a bit.",
    "Also great as a sexy lube. Not so good for your day to day cleansing needs as it may leave your face oily, but for removing make up its the best.",
    "I suppose that you could, if you so desired, tote this volume with you on your next birding trip. It would without a doubt help you figure out just what in the world that little brown job skulking in the brush pile might be. You could also mark it up with various notes about what you have seen, where you saw them, oddities, etc... There is plenty of room on the oversize (for a field guide at least) pages. I must say though that if you do either of the above things you had better buy two copies as the book is just plain gorgeous to look at and marring the pages seems a sin.It is clear from first glance that this is book is a labor of love, created by a man who is at the top of his field. The paintings are beautiful the text lucid. I could heap praise on this book all day. It is that good. I do however not think that it is really a field guide. It is too big and the two regional guides (Eastern and Western) that Sibley published after this one serve that purpose far better.Bottom-line: this is the best armchair field guide that I have seen.",
    "Needed the wrist cuff to keep debris out along with an adjustablewrist strap for snug fit and easy-on, easy off.Wanted a fabric like leather for duribility and comfort withtextured grip palm pads for better grip, extra wear and durabilityAlso, needed the half finger design for complete fingertip dexterity.",

    "This product is fantastic, it's very easy to use and is easily the most for the money. Unfortunately I bought it from a company with a 95% rating, I've learned my lesson. The powercord that plugs into the actual machine, the one you have to have to make it work, doesn't even fit ! And this product was supposedly, \"New\" ? How is it new if you pop in an odd sized cheap chinese made power cord that doesn't even fit the Brother machine ?",
    "I bought this to replace the inutile E-Z Firefly stand and I was so impressed that I bought another one. The adjustable height is nice to have when you're cooking at night. And since I've either had my lanterns on the ground or table top, it's great to place it elsewhere so bugs can leave you alone.",
    "I am new to sewing, but not totally novice. I had helped and watched my mother and grandmother sew clothes for my sister, and took a few sewing lesson in home Eco. So, I would say that I have a very basic understanding of sewing. I have had my machine for at least 1 year.Things I really like about the sewing machine is the ease of which you can get the machine ready to go, and the automatic needle threader. (I hate threading needles).Now for the problems with the machine:The light by the needle is not nearly as bright as my old singer sewing machine. Almost to the point of saying the light is worthless.The cloth guides are only around the needle area. since the bobbin cover is clear plastic (instead of metal like the old days) I find guiding the cloth to be more of a task. Of course the task is not impossible, but for a beginner, it is slightly annoying.The sewing machine is extremely light weight. I do not except to get years of service out of this machine.And I wish there would have been some better instructions included with the unit.",
    "This table top music stand was just what I was looking for. I read all the reviews here and decided to purchase it. It is sturdy and easy to alter the angle. Plus you can't beat the price. Something similar in my local music store was around $40.",
    "I used these in our camper, and even though the wallboard is slightly textured, these Command Hooks seem to have a strong bond. I allowed the adhesive to set for 24 hours as directed before adding the hook. I've had my belts hanging on them for a few weeks and they've held up perfectly, even with the temperatures rising over 100 degrees inside the camper when it's not being used. The only problem to be aware of is that the hook is only as strong as your wall covering...it will adhere to the paint or wallpaper, but if that paint or wallpaper happens to not have a strong bond with the underlying wall, it will pull off.",
    "I use this glue pen for scrapbooking and the pen is very useful and works well. The tip is very fine allowing me to cleanly glue small cutouts onto my pages. I have also used the glue pen with glitter to write words or draw pictures on the pages. This works well and the letters/pictures turn out very clearly.",
    "I use this as a spotting scope for target shooting. So far everything I've looked at and worked with gets dicey at about 500 yds. It just depends on the conditions. But a rule of thumb is if the sun is out and you aren't being barraged with thermals you should be able to see at minimal 500 yds. So far I have not been disappointed in what I got for the price. When there are no thermals and good light, I can see very well at 500yds.I also like it's field of view. I was actually watching 4 targets the last time out without moving the scope. These are 12\" x 12 \" targets.I have a Schmidt and Bender 56mm scope and it's brightness and optics are actually better, but we are comparing a $2000 + set of optics to a &lt; $500 set of optics. I also have a NightForce 56mm scope and I would compare it's brightness as a little better.I have had quite a number of people use my scope for spotting and they are really amazed at it's performance vs cost. So I would say that if these guys would put in a MOA or mildot reticle, they could sell quite a few more to people who are in the sport of long distance shooting.At 600 yds on a good day like the last, I think this would have been fine. But no matter what scope you get, there are going to be some days you just have to walk up.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it doesn't have a hash reticle option, and the optics are really not the best. But I think price vs performance this is a keeper. So far I haven't run into anyone who could see something I couldn't.",
    "I use this for my 20 mon baby. It's great. very gentle, no irritation on skin or eyes. I can use it for her everyday without a dry skin problem. She loves it too. She always says \"my baby soap, love it\" when I put it on her.",
    "I ordered these because I use Krazy glue quite a bit and it's getting expensive, so I figured I save a few bucks! Well, you get what you pay for........... Two of the five tubes were almost empty when I opened them, only 2-3 drops in each. So, I ended up opening a third tube to finish the job I was working on. There was plenty of glue in this tube. However, the glue is SO thing/watery that when I turned the tube down towards my project the glue just poured out everywhere without even squeezing the tube! It ruined my project and ended up all over the place including my fingers. What a disappointment and a mess. The only good thing I have to say about this purchase is the glue works very well - it took over an hour to get it off my fingers",
    "I ordered this Maxwell caliper - at a very good price from an Amazon proprietor - to replace a flawed but higher priced Frankford Arsenal caliber. The previous device, even when calibrated, consistently had overestimated known .30 and .40 caliber diameters by more than 2/1000's, no small mistake for my needs. This item appears to be the same product, battery compartment cover and all, as the Frankfort. The difference - this works perfectly and accurately; complete with an installed battery and a spare. It is tight, easy to use and read - perfect for reloading.",

    "This being my first scrapbook attempt, I found that the Pioneer Family Treasures E-Z Load Memory Book was easy to use and I found that most of the colored paper was designed for the 12 x 12 features. Nice and heavy duty construction. The plastic cover is an added feature to help keep the book looking clean. The plastic cover also allows one to added photos, etc without the fear of tearing on the outside of the book.",
    "I just wanted to say that I use this pad all the time for my designing. Great paper for my purposes. This time the pad was delivered with a bend in the pad from shipping. I put in for a return, and the new pad was here in 2 days. Also as a bonus of no hassle the old pad was given to me to do what I wanted with it, I passed it on to a kindergarten class for drawing. a win, win. Thanks so much for doing better then the right thing for me.",
    "My ex used to wear this cologne all the time, and it was perfect on him. When he told me he wasn't able to find it at the dept. stores, I looked online and ordered some. It still suits him, but I do wonder if the formula has been changed somehow since Liz died; it didn't smell quite the way I remembered. It's not bad, just not quite as good.",
    "I have been a hairstylist for over 25 years, and this is, BY FAR, the best curling iron I have ever owned!! It delivers long lasting results. It has adjustable heat settings and is wonderful. I use it frequently in the salon to get the great soft curls that everyone loves. It heats up super fast and the heat is distributed throughout the iron pretty evenly. I call it my secret weapon. My clients love to come in for special occasions just so I can give them the soft pretty curls that are so in style right now. Do not hesitate to by this one. It is a winner for sure!!!",
    "I have 9 tattoos, and only used this stuff for one of them. Of my 9 tattoos, the one I used tattoo goo on sucks. Which I admit, was probably the fault of the tattoo artist, but he's also the one who recommended this crap. Plus, it's very messy and got ink all over everything. It sits on the surface of the skin, and turned the color of the tattoo, which got all over everything else. Since that fiasco, I've only used my tattoo artist recommended Lubriderm, it's so much less hassle. Any tattoo artist I've seen and respected, recommends Lubriderm lotion. Go that route.",
    "Works as described. I was up to 60 reps at a time which was putting alot of strain and pain on my wrists. The extended motion has reduced the number of reps I can do but I get better results. The swiveling action has also removed all of the strain and pain from my wrists. Great product. If pushups are irritating your wrists, then don't hesitate to get these. The one thing I don't like are the rubber handle covers, I would prefer a knurled metal handles.",
    "Bought this as a gift and is great! Definitely worth the price as it is a great value for the quality.",
    "Ordered this guitar for my daughter's elementary ed music class where she had to play a song on a guitar. She loves it. Her prof said he was glad she didn't get a low end wal-mart special. Good beginners guitar. She'd found one on the web ordered it and it turned out to be a child sized one. She was in a panic for a guitar so we found this one on the web and had it shipped one day. It didn't show up at Fed Ex when it was supposed to. We called back and Amazon shipped another one One-Day which got there barely in time. The original guitar order showed up four days later which she refused. Amazon handled the return nicely and waived the one day shipping charge. Very happy with the customer service. Not so happy with the shipping. Be sure you watch the progress of when it get's accepted at Fed-Exp.",

    "I've been shaving my head for about 20 years and decided to give this a shot, since I saw it on the store shelf, and had seen a documentary on the company.I'll give them this -- it is fun to use, and for me, it worked surprisingly well. I can't say that its any faster overall than using my trusty Mach 3 or Fusion, but, its nice to use -- just to try something different every once in a while. I still use one of my old workhorses to get around my ears. But going over the top and down the back, it did a good job and was probably does take a little less time in those areas.So all in all, I think its pretty good tool, and a novel invention.",

    "This glove is made rugged and very durable. For a winter glove it keeps your hands toasty even in the coldest Pennsylvania winters. I have owned many other brands including some of the more expensive military work gloves, with varied and limited satisfaction, however the Youngstown Winter Plus glove, has for it's affordable price and quality far surpassed my expectations! I LOVE THESE GLOVES!! Most the guys in my troop have these gloves and are very pleased with the performance, wear and durability. An A+++ in my book!Frank",
    "Good lock, and it fits my S&W; .357 revolver nicely.I needed a trigger lock if I was to keep a handgun in the house (quoth the wife). So I chose this one, as it's a Master Lock (reputation for quality is upheld) and it has a combination lock (so I couldn't lose the key).One star off because, yes, if you put in up to 1,000 combinations, you're going to eventually open the lock. (Although for me, the quick access is more valuable than that possibility, as I don't have children yet.)Ideally, I'd prefer a good, locking case that both protects the stainless finish and is a little more secure. But the price was right ($10, vs. $50+ for a locking case), the firearm is secure and I get quick access should I ever need it.",
    "I use this with a small room fan - it lets you \"dim\" a fan instead of a lamp - works well. The control is not as fine as with other (older) westek dimmers that I have - guess they don't build 'em like they used to. But this is half the price of those older gizmos and it does the job.",
    "For the home studio, this package is quite enough. Alesis provides great quality products both for amateurs and professional. I've used a lot of Alesis products inside professional recording studios, which were excellent; and when it comes with their nano devices, they also deliver the goods. The nanoverb is an industry classic that started with another classic - the midiverb back in the late 80s. Get this model if you have a home recording studio. You won't regret it.",

    "I had purchased 8 of these hard inverted mantles from American Mantle, but when I tried to replace 2 old mantles I had in my outdoor gaslamp, 1 of the new ones I just purchased crumbled when I took it out of the box and another would only light on one side. I have ordered from this vendor before and of the six I had previously bought, 1 would not light at all for some reason. I don't know if this company's stock is too old, not being stored/handled properly, or just lacking in quality control, but caveat emptor.",
    "My boyfriend and I moved to our new house and saved a ton of money moving everything ourselves thanks to this product. Moving the major appliances was easy.

    "These sketchbooks are really great. The lighter paper makes for more pages. The pages have sufficient \"tooth\" to grip your media, but aren't as stiff or toothy as the 80 lb paper. The pages are large. Since it is spiral bound, it is easy to flip pages behind, rather than having to tear them out and store them.",
    "This is a pretty solid Electric Violin. The plastic makes it light to hold, and that may be an issue for some as I like to feel the weight of an instrument to make it feel solid. The shoulder rest materials they give you are not worth installing, since they just fall off, and you would be better off to make your own, or buy one. Otherwise it sounds good and the headphone option is nice even though somehow this violin makes it's own reverberations without it, so you can also hear it without amplification or headphones, it just doesn't sound that good. Remember that if you have headphones on playing it next to someone.",

Hoses fit snugly enough that a couple turns on a hose clamp is all you need to form a good seat, but not so tightly that you can't get the hoses back off without feeling like you're going to rip them apart.Very good adapter for those having tools with the 1-1/4\" dust ports.",

    "I had been looking for foldable bikes to carry in my motorhome that would fit in the underneath storage. I had purchased others but they were never compact enough to fit my compartments plus unfolding and folding back was a pain with the others.Mobiky fit the bill! They are absolutely fantastic. They fold in 3 seconds and unfold in the same amoust of time. Plus they easily fit in the storage compartments of my Class C motorhome. First glance will tell you these are higher quality than the other larger folding bikes. If you have been looking for the lightest, easiest foldable bike this is it.",
    "This books picks up where the instruction manual leaves off. I recently purchased a serger and this book helped me to familiarize myself with the machine, different types of threads and the various types of stitches that can be made with a serger. The photos and clearly written instructions in each chapter made me very comfortable with my machine. The author provides the right amount of detail to guide you step-by-step without becoming overwhelmed. I highly recommend this book to beginners, but it's also a good resource for the more advanced.",
    "Nascar Thunder 2003 is definitely the best racing game ever created. The graphics are unbelievable, the cars look awesome, and the racing is so realistic that any NASCAR junkie would love to buy this game.First of all, you can choose from over 50 NASCAR drivers and what seems like over 100 different paint schemes. You can even unlock legendary drivers such as Richard Petty and (the infamous) Dale Earnhardt!The racing itself is fantastic. Rubbing fenders and smashing into other cars-awesome! Nothing like seeing Jr. falling back out of sight. Throw in spectacular wrecks and knocking others out of the way, and you've got the perfect racing game.One of the most fun features of the game is Lightning Challenge. Battle your way through over 20 challenges ranging from easy to extremely difficult. I've been able to unlock Legends, Busch Series drivers, and even Tiburon, a 3 mile fantasy track where you race over 230 mph with no restrictor plates-sweet! I've also been awarded alternate tracks. It's awesome being able to race on everything from a night race at Rockingham to a road course race at Pocono.All in all, don't even bother renting this game before you buy it. It is amazing! Get Nascar Thunder 2003 while you can!",

    "As long as you understand what you're buying -- then this is a terrific unit.What you're buying is the ability to do four-track recording, two tracks at a time.You can then mix those tracks down and dub them to stereo -- likely a cassette tape player or our computers' audio card to burn a CD or MP3.There will be two main people interested in this unit:- Singer-song writers who use a recorder to help them compose.- Budding musicians (even your kids) who want to produce simple demo tapes while learning the basics of multi-track recording.DO NOT buy this unit to record your next chart-topping hit!Buy this this unit if you want cheap, easy, good-enough multi-track recordings for your own purposes. Don't expect studio-quality -- this is basically a consumer quality recorder, reconfigured for musicians.I think Tascam deserves praise for keeping a model like this on the market. There are certainly more powerful and better-sounding multi-track recorders but there are times when you just want cheap and easy.For cheap and easy, this unit is a good as it gets.",

The play/cue buttons are terrible too, so mixing and blending can be a pain when you have to press the button repeatedly for it to play. I can't seem to get a scratch effect either, though it's supposed to be capable of it. If that sound it makes when you spin the wheel is what they are calling scratch, then the effect needs some work. If you're just doing house parties and/or want a DJ toy, get this. Otherwise get turn tables (CD or Vinyl) and Final Scratch.",

Further, this one uses a technology that is different from and far more accurate than my previous pendulum-based pedometers.

It is meant for facial treatment, but feels great on any dry spot, hands, knees, elbows, feet, etc. Ahava has a clean, fresh smell, and, as advertised, leaves no greasy residue. I have not found a moisturer I like as well, including the expensive-selling and/or well-advertised brands.",

    "After going to school for Strategic Studies and Political Science, I knew I was destined to become a World Leader. What I also knew was that the amount of pot smoking I have done in the past would certainly come up in some CIA file. After looking over some old college papers I remembered a way I could become a world leader without having to do so in the US. I thought about taking over a small South American country and knew all I needed was a small army to do so. But there is only one catch, I couldn't find the funding! I knew if I could find an item like my brothers in Iran, to blackmail the world that I could be in an better position to fulfill my dream. Thats where the \"Uranium Ore\" comes in. The ore is sent in a very pleasant packaging that is easily transported throughout the world. In fact I had an entire shipping container filled with the \"Uranium Ore\" sent to me from a very friendly operator. Their customer service understood my plight, making it a point to follow through with a call three weeks after the \"Uranium Ore\" arrived to insure its success! My investment in my dream was affordable like nothing I had ever seen.While getting a shipping container filled with \"Uranium Ore's\" may not get you to have your own country, what you can bank on is that your uranium will be Top Notch. I ordered it, and now I am sitting pretty laundering American drug money in my South American banks. I have also taken the advise of my friends in Bolivia and will be allowing farmers to grow coke plants legally. Then I will be able to funnel the drugs to the US, all the while creating a network of Private Rehab facilities, in order to profit from the influx of my drugs. While the US will be unable to come into my country because of my container of \"Uranium Ore's\" I will be sitting pretty being driven in my motorcade of Bentley's with spinning rims and women in G-String bikinis. Maybe I will even get a picture with former US President Bill Clinton...",
    "I recently bought two sets of these from two different company's. Both sets are junk and are going back.The quality of these are not the Brown and Sharpe of the past. The advertised (Parallel within +/-0.0002\" - paired +/-0.0002\") is not true. The 1.5\" pair has deburred edges that has been done with what looks like a deburring buffing wheel. This has left the locating surfaces with rounded over edges. Also the the height difference betweenthe two is .020\"(this is not a typo) and not +/- .0002\". I can by cheap China made stuff that is a lot better.Do not waste your money.",
    "I have bought every kind of acne cleanser imaginable. From clean and clear sacylic acid based products to Proactiv. I have had acne for over 11 years. I finally decided that I'm going to try the store BP since its so much cheaper than these expensive brands (Proactiv)I have extremely oily skin. So a scrub is great. This scrub in the morning with the weekly Clear Pore Daily Mask/Cleanser worked wonders. In the evening, I use Maximum Oxy Clean 10% BP...If you can get to a dermatologist, I suggest getting Clindamycin Phosphate Lotion and Retin A .01%All of this combined....my face is perfectly clear.In the morning I use this scrub, following the clindamycin phosphate lotion. Then afterwards I use the neutrogena visibly smooth sunscreen with vitamin e.In the evening I use Oxy face wash followed by the Retin A.I promise you, this is the best regimen. Even alone, this scrub can do wonders on your face. I absolutely love this product. It got rid of all my acne. If you buy this, definitely buy their sun screen with vitamin e and the mask version of it.",
    "Right after the warranty ran out, the only effect it would create was heavy distortion with flange. No matter what setting I switched to, it only produced one effect. The volume was low and refused to respond, too. Once I managed to get it to respond to the controls by powering it down and back up, but that lasted about ten minutes.When it worked, the tones were thin and artificial sounding. This thing does not deserve the Line 6 label, and they should have the self-respect to NOT ever sell it again. Utter crap. Don't bother.",

It saved my old utility scissors from the trash can. They are as good as new. And I no longer have \"junk\" scissors for use on plastic and \"good\" scissors for use on paper only! This little thing can make them all like new. It may not perform like the more expensive sharpeners, but it does a great job and the price is right.",

They lasted me until earlier this year when my shepherd mutt puppy got a hold of them. (They probably would have lasted many more years otherwise.) I looked everywhere for these gloves and finally bought them on Amazon. They came in perfect condition and have been well used since. They fit perfectly, and the interior is lined with sort of a soft fabric. They make all of my cleaning much easier.",

    "I'm buying a second pair of these brushes because I lost mine in Superstorm Sandy. I tried to get by with Vic Firth brushes, which are good, but after playing with my friends last night I decided I just had to go ahead and replace these.First of all, the brushes themselves have an excellent sound. They are just the right amount of stiffness and somehow sound softer while still projecting well. My chops are limited but I find I can get a wide range of brush sounds easily with these sticks. Also, to me the tines of the Vic Firth brushes are too short to get the versatility I want.But the key feature is the handles, which can be used to hit the rim with a sound that is very similar to a wooden stick. This means you don't have to fumble around grabbing for a stick at the bridge when you want to do rim shots. Grooves like bossa nova are of course great with sticks like these.There is a steel bead at the end of the stick that I use in various ways on cymbals for subtle effects. I've also held the tines and used the brushes like a stick on the ride.Currently I'm playing mostly roots rock, I have a jazz background, and my chops are intermediate at best, so I believe these brushes are great for beginners as well as pros.",
    "I'm part of a 4 piece contemporary Christian group that doesn't have a sound guy. Sometimes I also do solo or duo gigs. Most times, I run sound from the stage, which is almost impossible. Often, I don't even have anyone to help me with sound checks. The 482i doesn't fix all my problems, but it does allow me to play at reasonable volumes with increased intelligibility, which I was unable to accomplish by myself. A common problem I had before I bought my 482i was that some people complained the sound was too loud, while others complained they couldn't hear. With the 482i, that problem is greatly reduced. I get a nice, punchy sound that enhances vocal clarity and doesn't require endless EQ, or other tweaks.If you've got a good system with a knowledgeable person to operate it, you probably don't need this. But I'm already singing, playing keyboards and guitar, and sometimes operating a drum machine with foot pedals, so I need all the help I can get. My PA usually consists of a cheap Behringer mixer, this 482i Maximizer, a Samson sx1200 amp, a couple of Behringer B205d monitors, and a pair of Behinger B212XL speakers on poles. A very simple setup, but made much better by the inclusion of the 482i.",

    "As the previous reviewer has stated this isn't the easiest yarn to work with. This is a textured yarn & thus should be treated as such when purchasing. It would work great for loom knitting, or other craft projects but as a crocheter or needle knitter I would only recommend if you are experienced.It has a thick texture feel with a lot of lumps & bumps. That aside, if you enjoy creating unique projects using mixed textures & yarns as I do this is a great option. It is not as soft or thin as other boucles I have used. It has a much thicker texture which creates a very unique project. It is perfect for Fashion items such Hats, Scarfs, Purses, Backpacks etc. I have not found another yarn with this unique chunky texture (except other bernat brand boucle) so I often order it for projects...HOWEVER it seems quite pricey on here. Buying it at other craft stores even online it is about 1/3 cheaper elsewhere.(currently $8.69 on Amazon & $5.99 elsewhere)",
    "If you are pin basting a quilt top, you need a lot of pins, so one package won't do it. But, the curved shape makes all of that pining goes faster and easier. I like this size, rather than the smaller ones --- again I find it easier to manipulate them.",
    "As a more classical violinist, I have always played on an accoustic. Recently, I have been doing more \"band\" and \"rock\" performances, so I decided to invest in an electric. This is a great violin, not stellar enough for recording probably but good enough for fun stage shows. The unique body style attracts lots of attention from audience members and the ability to use it as a practice violin while my daughter is sleeping (you can still hear it when \"un-plugged\", just very soft) has been an added bonus. As for quality of sound, well, I guess I'm just spoiled to the nice robust tone of my accoustic. Maybe with more amplifier experience, I may be able to achieve a better quality?!? This violin does come with a terrific soft case, all the cords needed, a set of headphones and a bow. I will note that the bow is pretty cheap (fiberglass I think) - not the worst bow ever made but you may want to replace it with a better quality one. Also, you will probably need to take it to a music store or violin maker to have the bridge placed properly and buy some additional fine tuners/peg dope (they only send you one on the E string) and the quality of the tuning pegs isn't the best. However, having sounded so negative... I am loving playing it! What a rush when you hear your high A tremolo come out of the amp! An exciting product of musical technology!",

    "I purchased a set of brushes as a backup for when I clean the first set I got (handi buki, flawless face and full coverage face). These brushes were not the same as the ones I purchased from the Bare Escentuals section at Ulta the week before. The handi buki is smaller, hard and the bristles do shed like made. The other two brushes are also harder and shed a lot in comparison to the brushed purchased in store. None of them apply the product as well as the good ones. It did not apply the foundation nearly as well as the original. It is horrible. I will go to Ulta and purchase a new proper set so I wasted my money here.The name printed on the side of these brushes is id Bare Escentuals. The GOOD brushes bought in store do not have the \"id\" on them. This makes me wonder if these brushes are not genuine?FYI the real BE brushes available at Ulta are fantastic.",

This unit is very compact and has high performance for the price. The great thing is that the controls are very similar to the Excort so it is easy to train others to use it. I am very happy with it and the only area of concern is the RCA inputs which are set up for sing along disks, but in fact it is just one channel for left audio and the other channel for right audio.

I also wanted something that would be nice my records, so I looked up Grado. Though I am sure the gold, black, green, etc. would've been good, I thought I would spend a few extra bucks and get the red stylus. Man, was it worth the investment. It gives all of my music that 'warm' sound that vinyl enthusiasts talk about, the range of sound is amazing. no 'tinny' sounds, all the power of what a turntable system should sound like. people say 'dude are we listening to a cd?' I say, 'no, it's my turntable with a killer needle.' You won't be disappointed.",

    "I bought this stand thinking it was the model that had the FOLDING legs that slid into the main compartment. I was mistaken. The legs are, as advertised, permanently attached. They can be unscrewed using an Alan wrench, and then placed into the tower, however I found it VERY difficult to do so, fearing I would scratch the outer paint. The arms are very sturdy so long as you're using a light, compact keyboard. I have a full sized 76-key synth on the bottom, and depending how into my playing I get (when I start hammering away on the keys), the stand does shake. As for the top stand, I have a portable 61-key synth. While it's sturdy, if I only have one hand resting on the pitch bend, while the other hand is busy doing whatever else, the keyboard tilts in that direction - which isn't a fault of the stand, but instead of physics. This stand looks great, travels great, doesn't show much wear and tear from gigs, and is pretty much customizable to any height requirements. Keep in mind the MIC BOOM is NOT INCLUDED. And the stand doesn't have a handle like the one in the picture does, either.",
    "I decided to purchase one of these for an alterative to my stardard MPH and milage guage for my motorcycle. I finally got the space and connections correct and it seems to work. A front motorcycle tire is a bit odd, compaired to a bicycle tire - size and travel. The speed has been off about 5-9 MPH slow and I will need to mess around with the tire size setup to dial it in. Should not be a problem.........But...... for milege, trip odometer, clock, light and other calculations, this unit should work close enough for what I'm looking for. I'm glad they sell replacment parts (sensors, etc) here for this bike computer !!",

I'm 62 now and I'm tired of breaking needles, machines that are too hard to thread and dialing for tension and stitch length. It was always a guessing game. After totally destroying the whole needle assembly on my old Singer I got frustrated enough to make a snap decision to get a Brother-on line-sight unseen. I must say I was nervous about my decision. The machine arrived next day. Straight out of the box I assembled two lap blankets for my grandchildren.

The reason I have tried so many is because they have all disappointed me - until this one.I live in Las Vegas, where even in the winter, I am exposed to the sun and need sun protection, and this sunblock does the trick. Because there were so few good choices, I stuck with Prescriptives 40SPF, as that is my prefer ed brand of facial make-up and tried to stay out of the sun. It worked for me - until I took a trip to Disney World in August. I knew that I would need something strong and effective for my trip to be enjoyable for me and my friends. This sunblock was amazing. I was able to go the entire trip without even a trace of a sunburn - and we stayed in the sun from sun up to sun down.In Florida, I reapplied it every 3-4 hours but in between these times it weathered the humidity, rain, and sun like a champion. My skin is naturally dry, so I did not notice it to be greasy as other reviews have mentioned. I did not think that it left any color on my face or body.If you need a heavy-duty sunblock, and you have facial sensitivities, then this sunblock will work perfectly for you!",

    "I did quite a lot of research before buying this hairdryer. I was debating between this and another product that was around $90...I've always used \"cheapie\" dryers from the drugstore, and when mine stopped working, I decided I needed an upgrade. The reviews seemed good and the price was right - so decision made.First, let me say: Other reviewers have commented that this is unreasonably heavy. It is on the heavier side, but it's not at all uncomfortable and it actually helps me to gauge where I'm aiming it.Secondly, I don't think this hairdryer gets very hot. This is a huge plus for me, because I have thin hair and I don't think I could singe or burn my hair with this dryer. However, for someone with super thick hair, it might not do the job as well.With my old dryer, it took me 20-30 minutes to dry my medium length hair. With this dryer, I'm dry and ready to go in 10 minutes or less, so that is a huge plus.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and would buy this item again.",

So, I figured I get a Reel Echo, and leave the old `plex at home. When I first saw the unit, I was impressed that they designed it to resemble the sliding tape head instead of a knob for the length of the delay. Needless to say, it's just not the same. Doesn't have the right feel at all. And you can't get that great feedback loop either. Now I will admit, for the sound on sound function, it's perfect. But I've never needed to use that on my Echoplex. I will say that it is a good delay pedal, but if you want the sound of a real tape delay, the Reel Echo is not it.",

I have been using the \"Z\" style, but it took a long time to set up. This opens up immediately and is heavy duty. The only tradeoff is that it makes it somewhat awkward to carry, especially if you're not too tall. I put a bungee cord between the legs to keep them from swinging around. There is a little side-to-side play when it is all set up. I also bought the M-92 upper tier separately, and it seems they may have had different versions. The stand has a nut in the bottom of the frame while the second tier has the threads on the side. There was also no tool to adjust the second tier in the kit, but I found a couple metric screws, m8 x1.25 thread and the star drive screwdriver at the hardware store to complete my set up. So far so good.",

Its a hassle trying to pour sometimes because bbs get stuck in the nozzle and u have to tilt the bottle back and then pour some more in. 2000 bbs is not enough though if you are just starting airsoft.",

    "I had glasses that were covered with about a million fine lines and was having eyestrain using them. The warning next to the product name scared me, but I really felt I had no choice-- it was either this or buy new glasses! I followed everyone's advice: I washed them gently, then applied Armor Etch to a small section to see if it would work... it didn't seem to do anything, but then realized there was still film on the other side of the lens! So I just went for it, applying thickly to both sides of the lenses, still in the frame. After about 5 minutes, I rinsed, and it was amazing! There was still a little film stuck on there, but with a second application,it all came off. If you are worried like I was that it wouldn't work, don't worry, it works!!",

Well, it does measure inches, BUT if you want to get an accurate measurement in millimeters FORGET ABOUT IT. The metric scale is there but the dial is not calibrated - and the needle is not geared - for use with the metric system. 1.125 inches - no problem ; 28.45 millimeters - good luck!",
    "Spent $35 total on this cover and its far superior than the $60 one I bought from Lowe's awhile back. The AU logo is perfectly straight and isn't cheap looking at all which is what I was worried about since it was so cheap. The fabric is touch and 100% waterproof.Actually gave this cover to my dad cause it was abit tight since I have a double lid grill so I bought the same cover from the same manufacturer but a 68\" model cuz i was impressed with the other one. Either way....I am glad I bought 2 of these now.Highly recommended!!!",

    "This is my second Seiko. I still have my first. With this watch I see some well thought out improvements. The crown and both side mounted push buttons lock. This feature is long overdue in my opinion. This prevents accidental activation of the stop watch , or advancement of the time on the alarm. On the down side I found the owners manual a little vague, and lacking in instruction compared to the manual I got with my original Seiko. Also, I had to pay to have my band sized. On the original Seiko I bought, there were many adjustments available. Over all, I love this watch. It is beautiful, functions flawlessly, and has a very good feel to it.",
    "Nice product, well design does not move around with every pitch. Matter of fact, it does not move at all unlike others I have seen on the market.

    "Boy, I'm really not sure about this one. As a motion picture sound mixer of several decades, I've had no problems navigating around the controls of this home-use mini-console. I am confused, though, about some of the inexplicable fluctuations in output signal I've experienced. For seemingly no reason at all, the output will jump from not nearly enough to way too much, without my having done anything to influence it. I suspect that the cause is some sort of intermittent connection inside the unit, which, in this day and age of relatively consistant component standards, would show a rather shabby level of quality control. Frankly, even in this modest price range, you should at least be able to expect some stability in your signal flow.",
    "The Ogio Atlas is a well thought out bag with plenty of great options. Their patented rain cover is very cool,the best I've ever used. The bag is stylish and offers enough pockets for just about anything.The top club divider is awesome. The only drawbacks I've found are these: If you ever want to store or transport your golf shoes in your bag don't buy this one. There is no way to squeeze your shoes into the side pockets. The material is stiff and the pockets are very narrow. The other bothersome feature is the umbrella sleeve, which leaves a normal sized golf umbrella sticking up higher than your driver by about 4\". If rain isn't in the forcast, you don't want to just leave the umbrella in the bag, it's too annoying. Otherwise, a very nice bag.",

The bad thing is that for the largest case, i placed my power foundation and its a bit too small for that. i use the lid to spread the foundation and the powder gets stuck in between the screw lines and causes the container to become loose.

    "These scissors have a lovely positive action and extremely comfortably grips. The edges seem a bit rough and they were not great for collage on paper-Matisse would probably disapprove.

I called Simplicity's 1-800 customer help number at least 10 times; a machine answered every time. I left three messages and NEVER received a call back in two weeks. No other number is listed for the company. I finally returned the sewing machine through Amazon. (And I can't say enough about how great Amazon is about returns when something is wrong with the product - much appreciated!) I then bought another sewing machine but it is NOT a Simplicity - why buy from a company that won't even return your calls? I got a Brother instead ... so far, so good.",

    "This hot roller set is dual voltage. It is good for traveling outside the US. The issue is that it is only 85 watts so it takes very very long time to get ready for the job. (Conair has two or three other roller sets with 580 watts or more--the one with 580 watts heat up and ready for use in two minutes!! And it is only $9 more). This set does warm up with 90 seconds as advertised but it is not hot enough. I waited for about 30-40 minutes before I used it. The clips that come with this unit do not work so I bought jumbo clips separately. If you don't need a dual voltage, buy a stronger watts unit for faster heat.BTW, 12 rolls are not enough for thick hair. The rolls size are a bit too small for big curl results. I spent about an hour to set my hair with this unit. But, the process would be cut by half, if I had have used a strong watts unit. I need a dual voltage set so I don't have many choices.Update.....a month later...Now I use it in Thailand. I am very surprised to learn that this unit heat up within 10 minutes!!!! With more experience, I can do my hair to look professional in less than 30 minutes. Everyone said, the curl looks natural and look like I walk out from the salon. I would recommend this product to all travelers.PS: I am not sure whether this product damages my hair. But I guess all products with high heat will eventually damage hair.",

    "I was looking forward to a more \"natural\" product to replace my mascara (my favorite is Bobby Brown's Everyday mascara). This mascara goes on extremely light, probably partly due to the type of applicator (the bristles are thin with large spaces in between). It's great if you want to look like you are not wearing anything, with just a little accent of the lashes, but it really just subtly highlights your lashes. I should say that I do not like heavy mascara; I'm very careful to put Bobby's on lightly. I always prefer my make-up to look as natural as possible, but this mascara seems a little pointless except for very casual wear. But, if you are looking for just a little highlight, this may be the way to go. The tube has a small mirror on the side and the smell of the mascara is pleasant enough.",

Unfortunately I didn't notice how short they are. My last batch were something like 12-14\" long, these are 8\" -as it clearly states- but I was in a hurry.

I've had the others for about a year and I panic when I think my children have absconded with them. They have been awesome. Because I have liked them so well, I was very curious about how these would handle. These scissors are great for paper, but they don't do as well on cardboard as my other pair. The handle feels slightly cheaper (I like the ridges on the other pair). I can cut thin fabric with them and tape as well. These scissors just feel differently than the other pair. They're lighter duty scissors, clearly. For that purpose, they're great. They do cut evenly, easily, and are comfortable to hold. For the price, they're a good value, I think. If you need heavier duty scissors, I'd recommend looking at one pair of the others.I'm thankful to have two more pairs to spread out around our house.

    "I've been using several different programs from ancient to modern, and none of them possess the ease of operation combined with good results. This program will teach you step-by-step, and also help you find parts if you don't have everything you need. You're most difficult step falls on what type of system you have, (that includes your turntable & computer). If you can get your turntable/stereo system to connect properly with your computer you've completed the hardest task! And Spin It Again will help you with this part!For those of you who might be younger let me fill you in: this program works with rare, and hard to find vinyls. I listen to NSBM, industrial, power electronics, folk, old pop, classical, Oi, metal, big band, etc. and it works with them all (though the noise and power electronics can be tricky!)Bottom line is, this transfering stuff can become a part-time job, and this program will help speed you through the process.

    "So if you read the label, it says that it's scientifically proven to reduce 99.9% of bacteria in less than one minute. Well that's the trick. I've been using the Murad kit for about a year now and when I first started I didn't think it did much. I read somewhere that you should rub it into your skin for at least a minute so I tried that and wow, HUGE difference! I'm not kidding. If this hasn't worked for you, try rubbing it on your face focusing on the problem areas for at least a minute. You should feel a tingling sensation. That's when you know it's working. Give it about a week or two and you should see dramatic results. I'm not going to lie and say that I haven't had a pimple since using it, but it is so much more under control and I don't consistently have to wear make-up to hide it.Also another tip, if this kit made you break out even more then try skipping the exfoliating gel. My boyfriend tried this kit and the gel made him break out. Taking that out made a huge difference.",
    "My brothers had mohawks in school (early 1960's)and I had alwayswanted one but being a girl my parents didn't see any light in that request. 40 years later and going through chemo I finally got the chance to fulfill my long inquisitive desire. I had an old wig which I cut from front to back, trimmed it, sprayed it and there it was, my mohawk. Now I had to have something that would adhere to the wig and my scalp without irritation, would not leave a sticky residue, would not tear my wig or my scalp up, and at the same time be comfortable. I tried two sided tape, scotch tape, electrical tape, packing tape, you name it. Then I saw the duct tape by the A/C unit and bingo, I had my mohawk. Not only am I enjoying this but family, friends, co-workers, and complete strangers are enjoying it as much if not more. Thanks to DT",

    "Red Heart Super Saver Yarn is a pretty great bargain. Michael's sells it for about $2.99 (I doubt it's much different at other large brand craft stores) and as you can clearly see, you get a lot for a little and there are a good deal of colors to choose from. The yarn itself is 100% acrylic - part of the reason it's so inexpensive. To some, this can be a serious drawback. Many people dislike the somewhat scratchy feel of it, and I can't blame them. It's not the softest yarn in the bunch, but who can be surprised with such a nice price? I would not recommend this yarn to use for sweaters or other clothing items. Unless you're making it for yourself and don't mind the somewhat scratchiness. (Note: a single wash can help ease the scratchiness.) Another thing to note is many people are \"yarn sensitive\" and acrylic can bother the skin. In which case, I'd look for cotton and other natural fiber yarns. But on the flip side, Red Heart Super Saver is perfect for stuffed animals, dolls, and amigurumi of that sort. It's durable, especially when you figure that you won't be throwing your amigurumi in the wash that often. I find it easy to work with, especially because it's a tight yarn and stuffed toys generally benefit from Red Heart's tightness. Unless you're making a stuffed toy for a baby to snuggle with, it's great for children's toys. And, who can forget the price! A few other drawbacks, though minor, I noted are that I tend to find a couple superficial tangles in the skeins that annoy but do not ruin the whole thing. Also, I occasionally pick up a skein that just doesn't work the way I'd like it to. For example, I bought a skein of the skin colored one and found that it just didn't work like the other skins of RHSS did. I guess there are lemons in every product, but still a bit annoying.Overall...PROS:- Excellent price- Large color palette, including some unique multicolored options- Widespread availability- Good for making stuffed toys/amigurumi- Easy to work with for many- Lot of yarn included- Durable sans the washing machineCONS:- Scratchy (though one wash can help soften it up)- Acrylic (only a con for some)- Splices a little easier than other yarns (I repeat, you get what you pay for!!)- Wears after a couple washes- Occasional little tangles in the skein- Some skeins are lemonsOverall, I recommend this yarn for someone who would like to use it for toys, not garments. Blankets and large afghans, I think it would work for that too as long as it wasn't designed to be soft or sensitive on the skin.",

    "This metronome is very small -- slightly larger than a credit card, and just a quarter inch thick or so. This makes it handy for use on the road, but there are tradeoffs. First, the maximum volume is not all that loud. Second, because of the size, there are only four buttons on the unit, and the user interface thus has to do the rest: if you want to adjust the volume, for example, there is no simple \"volume\" knob or button. You have to use the \"select\" button and cycle through the various options, and then decrease/increase volume.For regular home use, then, this is not the ideal unit, in my estimation. I'd prefer something that is more quickly/easily adjustable, and louder.",

So I purchased this item and mounted behind the plywood. It was easy to drill the screw holes. It is plenty thick enough. Now I think my back stop could handle .22lr from 25 yards.

After pre-heating the thermos with hot tap water for about 10 minutes, I poured near-boiling water at 190 degrees F into the thermos and screwed on the cap. After 13 hours I took off the cap, stuck in a thermometer, and viola - after 13 hours the temperature had only dropped 10 degrees to 180 degrees F! This thermos is fantastic! It holds enough coffee for almost three full mugs. I have two in the morning and when I get to the third in the middle of the afternoon, it's still piping hot! I'll be curious to see how long the thermos lasts, but after 3 weeks, I'm extremely satisfied with this product!",

    "I use these for basically everything that requires gloves, i have 6 or so pairs of these and they are all amazing",
    "I rarely comment on the tools that I buy, as I try to buy the best and expect them to be good. I use tools every day in my remodeling and cabinet business and this set really surprised me with its' quality and thoughtful layout. It is easy to see that someone put a lot of thought into how these bits and drivers were laid out in the superb case. The whole set feels and looks like the highest quality of steel and construction was used throughout. The case holds all of the pieces firmly but not so firmly that they can't be taken out and used easily. The case is compact and has the feel that it will last a long time.Now to the selection of bits and drivers. There seems to be exactly what is needed for the drilling and driving of screws and hex fastners. The quick connects are of superb quality and work easily and with positive action. There is a great set of hex drill bits that go from 1/16\" to 1/4\" by 32nds to 1/8\" and 16ths up to 1/4\". Included is a tool to drive screws in difficult places that looks to be very usefull. A more than adequate selection of phillips and flat bits are supplied and arranged to be really easy to use. The pictures of this set ,while good, can't relay the quality feel of it all. I can't recommend this highly enough. You can spend your money knowing that you will get great value for it.",
    "These bits were fine for utility work but when used for any finish work.. (i.e. mounting hardware or trying to drill w/o going all the way through) they are too hungry for the wood. The larger bits don't actually drill through the wood so much as drill into it like a screw. Even when being extra careful to apply light pressure the drill was twisted out of my hand as the bit tore through my workpiece. while drilling through some Maple Plywood drawer fronts the bit pulled the workpiece up off the table and out of my hand leaving a large chipped out area of veneer on the face of my piece. I also wasn't impressed with the pilot point, the bit still walked. Nothing beats an awl or center punch for accurate drilling",
    "While I like the sound and durability of these sticks, the main advantage for me is the grip. I had a set of these many years ago, went away from drumming, then recently got back behind the kit. After playing for a couple weeks with wooden sticks, I desperately wanted these again. For me, I just can't get the same comfort and grip from standard wooden sticks; these result in fewer blisters and longer playing time. Also, I like the added weight that the grips give in the butt of the stick, which allows for some playing techniques (a different bounce off the ride, for example) when you learn to hold them a certain way.PROS: I know a lot of drummers like grip tape on wood sticks, but I don't. And when playing fast-tempo or hard stuff, I think these grips are better. The sticks themselves are very durable, especially if you love smashing your cymbals. Slight extra weight of the rubber grips gives you a different balance when holding the stick, which can help with certain techniques.CONS: Very different feel from wood sticks, which you may not like. If you ever play with the butt end of the stick (as Nicko McBrain of Iron Maiden does on the snare), these may not work for you. Of course, you can do it, but the feel and sound is very different.Even if you don't want these to be your main sticks, I think they'd be a great addition for at least certain uses.",
    "I wear a size 11 shoe and on the chart on another website it said that a 45 was the equivalent to a size 11. come to find out the size i ordered was about a half size too big but they still fit fairly well. also, a big thing is that these are not actually feiyue brand shoes but they are knock offs. they still are very light, cheap and super comfortable. i cannot stress how comfy these shoes are. they might look a little strange at first but you get used to them. i like them. 6/10. would probably buy again.",

They arrived quickly and were very simple to set up: plug the power in, plug in my Airport Extreme cable, connect the two speakers with wire provided in the box, and stick the rubber cushions on the bottom of each speaker. They deliver crisp highs and decent bass (I prefer to leave the bass boost button on). Volume is more than enough for a living room. After over a month of use, I am glad I bought them and would do so again.",
    "I tried this to remove badly dried and caloused skin on my toes and the bottom and back side of my feet. I worked perfectly every time. Uses sanding discs that wear very well and can be replaced. It uses 4 AA batteries instead of 2 and runs at a high speed unless you are foolish enough to force it hard against your skin. Also used it on some tough spots on my fingers, excellent result. Also does nails very easily. Seems to be well made and not cheaply made. Very glad I decided to try it.",
    "After reading the other reviews, I was torn as to what to do. Was this a genuine product or a knock-off that wouldn't work well with my Oreck. Having only a few days to finalize preparations for a house full of Thanksgiving guests and having used my last vacuum bag, I simply chose to \"take a chance.\" As with everything I purchase from Amazon, the bags arrived very quickly; and to my delight, they were exactly as described.

    "Bought the wife a Roomba Pro Elite for Christmas ( I'm the romantic type!) She's letting me play with it. First reactions: It's a high tech toy, not bad for a first generation product. Cheaply constructed, so I question it's longevity. Doesn't run very long on a charge and charging time is long. So I think it's good to invest in a separate charger and extra battery if you can spare the bucks. Small capacity particle bin so needs frequent emptying. Needs a fairly clean room to begin with. Surprising how much it can pick up in a supposedly clean room. Best on hard floors, but can handle short-nap rugs but not fringe. Doesn't get stuck as much as I thought it would. Overall it does the job and I like it.",

    "I, like many others liked the price. I own 8 Zip Wall poles and figured the 3rd Hand product would come in handy should I need more poles to create a barrier. I must state that my main reason for purchasing the 3rd Hand contractor pack was to aid me in a crown-molding job. I liked what I read about these units and it seemed like they would fit the bill with the square feet and all.I will start by saying that the company must have had many complaints with the poles being used to put up plastic barriers. The box that mine came in show several different uses for the poles in line drawing form. The picture of the poles being used for plastic barriers was covered up suggesting the possibility that they received some grief from Zip Wall, or customers frustrated by the attempt to use them in place of Zip Walls.Personally I find the 3rd hand product quite heavy and cumbersome to use for supporting plastic sheets. Especially when trying to get them up to 9 & foot ceilings! I had to use duct tape to get the plastic that high. Second, after I jacked the pole up onto the main tee and moved onto the second pole, the first pole came crashing down behind me as I jacked the second pole a little too much causing loss of tension on the first. OK so the 3rd Hand failed to please me on plastic barriers on tall metal grid ceilings. Onto the next project.For crown molding, the 3rd Hand is just that. They performed as expected. The slanting feet and square top plate kept the poles where I placed them. Laying the crown molding on top of the poles was a learning experience. When installing a 16' length of crown, you must place your ladder in the middle of the length so that you don't tip the center pole over or as in my first attempt, the 2 middle poles. Very noisy when they hit the floor. Once that lesson was behind me the rest of my 3rd Hand experience was non eventful.Back to grid ceilings, the poles are nice for jacking up the grids to help in leveling and also holding fluorescent fixtures while replacing grid work on wall relocations. I also used all four poles to raise the ceiling enough to slide a completely dry walled section to a new location 4 feet away without getting hung up on the ceiling grid. Just had to be careful the all the poles had the same tension on them.I agree with most other posters about the button problem. Very difficult to get them pushed in to raise or lower the pole. Raise the pole too high and you can't reach the jack handle. The solution there was to turn to pole upside down just to avoid readjustment with those button locks.The weight of all four poles in the bag is amazingly heavy. 8 Zip Wall poles are half the weight and being all aluminum well balanced. The tension mechanism on the Zip Wall units is a pleasure to use over the 3rd Hand unit. In all fairness, Zip Wall poles are not very good to use for crown molding and too light to use for holding grid ceilings up. Each of these poles has their place. Used on a regular basis it is best to use what each one was designed for, or be aggravated by the lack of compatibility that each system exhibits.I too have the same complaints about the storage bag being a few inches too small and lastly, would somebody please tell me what all the different bushings on the large plates are for? I'm still trying to figure out how the large feet attach. O NO! Not the directions!!! Still confused, I love my Zip Wall poles.",
    "These gloves are perfect for use on the farm. All my research for the best winter work glove paid off with this purchase. I bought another pair as a gift. I'll be recommending these gloves to anyone who works in cold wet conditions and wants to keep there hands safe and warm.",

    "I purchased this pack at about 1/3 of the cost of similar bags at the local outdoor retailer. While I am not a fan of internal frame packs, (personal preference), this pack did it's job. I hauled 45#s on a 6 day 25 mile trip into Oregon's Wallowas. The pack held up well, had plenty of pockets for separation of all my stuff. The pack is a little heavy at 5.5 #s but is worth the cost trade-off to me. Next expedition I'm going back to the Jansport Carson external frame because I can better distribute weight to my hips, has better air circulation to my back and has the frame to attach tent and sleeping bag to allowing for more room inside the pack.",

Otherwise, the stamps are well-made and sturdy.",
    "I use these for a slightly different purpose. They work very well as a kayak leash. I clip one of them on to the front handle and I can pull my kayak up river when it gets too shallow to paddle, before getting back in on the other side of the shoals. That way the kayak just follows behind and you don't wear yourself out bending over to hold the handles. You also can stay more on the rocks while the boat glides around them. Sure, I could have made one out of a piece of rope, but two of them was cheap enough that it wasn't worth it.",

Some tools are required for assembly, most notably a large allen wrench.",
    "As this has no insulation it is obviously not intended for extended winter use. It does have a little cushioning in it but not enough to get excited about. I know this sounds lack luster so far but I have used these gloves for two or three weeks with no complaints. They seem to be sturdy, durable, and fit as well as a leather glove of this type should be expected to. If you're looking for something that is going to fit you like a second skin, this isn't the type of work glove you need to be looking at. If you're looking a good all pupose glove then these will do.(UPDATE) I have had and used these gloves almost daily for months now and they have held together while doing everything from chopping/stacking wood to carrying stone to simply raking and shoveling. I stand by my original recomendation, for the price you're getting a great pair of gloves.",

I wish amazon would look for a mat that is say 2 1/2 to 3 feet wide and 6 feet long with some firmness.",
    "Bought this training wheels for a six years old who decided she wanted a 20\" bike. Needless to say, I was having issues finding training wheels that would fit her bike. Maybe the frame was too high, so I looked for training wheels over 20\". After much research, and many hours in the computer, I finally came across this item. Thought to give it a try. The braces didn't quite fit the frame, but after much pounding with the hammer( and it wasn't easy at all!), I finally got them to work.She's been riding the bike for over 4 months now, and she's not gentle with it, but the wheels have stayed put, and worked better than I thought. I highly recomment it for anyone looking for a sturdy set of training wheels.The box does say \"for a 3/4\" or smaller rear frame,\" so I suggest measuring the frame of the bike before you purchase, or get ready to pound it into submission like I did.",

    "I am giving this product 4 stars- the product itself deserves 5, but there is a discrepancy with the color that I have seen- with my hair and just looking at \"samples\" on different websites. So tho I whole-heartedly recommend Jerome Russell research that color! Ok, on to the review....I have dyed my hair many times with many of these brands and I know what I am doing- those little things you pick up from a lot trial and error. Jerome Russell is the best product I have ever used. I had no stained pillowcases, great lasting color, and hair that felt great, not like straw, and fingernails that did not look like the dye if you scratched your scalp. That said, I wanted PURPLE hair, and the only remotely purplish color was this, violet. I bleached first of course, tho my hair is light brown, and my hair turned black. And if you looked in the light, you could see a bluish purple sheen. Mostly bluish tho. This is disappointing to me, but at the same time it really complimented my looks, my complexion etc. After some weeks and there was very slight fade, the bluish purple was more pronounced. That is another thing, with cool water and shampoo/conditioner for color treated hair, it looks even more vibrant than the day I colored it. I am already putting an order in for 3 more colors from Jerome Russell.",

    "After reviewing many home sewing machine articles, I finally chose the Brother CS600i. Some of the reviews suggested difficulties with the automatic needle threader and/ or the bobbin tension settings. It is true that you have to look very carefully at the final thread retaining bail just above the needle to see which side to hook the thread on, but I finally got it figured out. The automatic needle threader is a bit tricky, but when I saw that the thread must be pulled up rather than down to catch onto the tiny hook,, bingo!The machine has the ability to automatically set the recommended stitch length and width dimensions and to tell you what foot to put on it. Unfortunately I had to use a small flash light to see the numbers and letters on the small screen. No big deal.So far the bobbin and thread tensions have not been a problem. What was confusing was the direction to &#34;baste&#34;titch without telling me how to do that. I found a clue in the frequently asked question in the Brother web site. All you do is set the tension wheel to 3 and the stitch length to 4. Again, Bingo!The machine has a narrower throat that my Viking, but this can be worked around with a bit of innovating.All-in-all I have have a lot of enjoyment just trying out all of the stitches described in the very complete instruction manual.Nice work, Brother..",

    "Terrible purchase. This item does not work for me. I bought it late December and ignorantly never tested it when I first got it. It probably wouldn't have helped much anyway. As the price and hassle for returning wouldn't have been worth the headache. Just tested this microphone the other day and it didn't work. I never used it previously. In fact, it was still in the box when I took it out to use this past week. I initially thought there was something wrong with my camera's microphone jack. However, I tested it on several other cameras, computers and on an MP3 recorder. Still nothing.It's incredibly difficult to find a durable, quality and inexpensive lav mic. I have purchased 2 other mics before this one and they never last. They'll just crap out on you during the middle of a shoot. Or you'll go to test the sound before filming and realize it has surpassed its 3 month design. Can't imagine how it's so difficult to find a halfway decent microphone to plug straight into a camera or recorder.Don't waste your time or money. Even if you get one of these and it works out of the box, my guess is it won't last long.Pass over this and keep looking.Good luck!",

It was thin enough to fit in cup holder, while the colored versions of this product (different page) are a bit too wide. The opening is a bit bigger than store water bottles, but it is the smallest I found and very close.If you want a thin, cup holder fitting, narrow opening, reusable water bottle like the store brands, this is the one!

They were 5A's, so they were lightweight, easy to grip, and were very easy to move around. When you play drums fast, it helps to have a stick that is not too heavy to use. These also had a lacquer coating, so they had a good grip. My only problem with these were that they had wooden tips. I learned that wooden tips seem to come apart and shred after a while, but only if you're hitting cymbals, not if you're just hitting drums. If you decide to buy these sticks, buy the kind with a nylon tip, they will last longer.",

Due to not packing the item properly resulted in two large dents in the case. The case itself works well and is of decent quality. I would not recommend purchasing anything from this particular supplier due to their inability to properly pack and ship an item. However I would recommend the case itself. It works well and looks good (except for the dents)!",

    "This is a terrific night cream.The container is wide mouth and allows for easy application. The smell is simply lovely. Texture is non-greasy & smooth. But most importantly-it works well. Apply this, and within 5-10 minutes, it is fully absorbed. I am so tired of using night creams and having to lie on my back till they absorb. As a side sleeper/reader, I get awfully tired of spending money on cream just to slick up the pillow-case. With this marvelous cream, it absorbs readily into your face, not onto your pillow.I noticed a significant improvement almost immediately in my skin with this night cream. It is gentle, hypoallergenic, and just simply great overall.Well done, Olay! The price is much better than others and performs better, too. This is the cream that won the coveted #1 spot against LaPrairie, etc., etc......",

A coworker of mine suggested that I try this cleanser because she had success with it in the past.The product is great! My skin began to clear within 2 days of using this cleanser (in addition to Dermadoctor Emergency Spot Relief Treatment). I alternate between this cleanser and a non-acne one, as all acne cleansers tend to be drying (even though this one is extremely gentle). The cleanser does not sting or burn at all, and my skin is not left feeling tight and dried out after rinsing. A little product goes a long way with this cleanser. I think the 4 ounce bottle will last me for a couple of months.The only reason I gave it less stars was because it is pricey. But the results are worth it, so I guess you get what you pay for!",

    "This shampoo has a very nice and light perfume smell and works wonders for dry hair or color treated hair. I tried Cutler products at the Gansvoort Hotel in South Beach Florida while staying as a guest and after a couple of days I notice my hair was softer and less dry. It lathers just alittle, not like commercial shampoos that lathers way too much and drys out the hair. The conditioner is one of the best I have ever used, and I used many of the top brands that sell at the salons. I like the Cutler extra gentle shampoo and the intensive conditioner for my color treated hair the most relative to other salon products within the same price range. I do think it is pricey for 8oz's of shampoo but I also use less to clean my hair. Definitely, it is worth giving these Cutler shampoos and conditioner a try if you're looking for softer and clean feeling hair.",
    "I'm a great believer in Olay products (my mother's been using them for over 30 years) so when I saw an extra dry skin lotion by this company, I bought it. I didn't realize that it would smell so strong.I'm afraid that most artificial scents give me headaches. I have to stay away from most perfumes, air fresheners, scented candles, potporri, etc, because it triggers migraine headaches. So if you're like me, you'll want to avoid this. Even my husband, who isn't bothered by most strong scents, couldn't stand the smell of this lotion. I now only use it on my very dry feet, and then I have to wash my hands right afterwards.Also, the lotion is quite sparkly, and I'm not a person who wears glitter. (Never did, and I'm a child of the 80s!) If I'd known that this product was so strong-smelling and glittery, I'd never have bought it.That being said, it is a very good moisturizer. If strong scents and glitter don't bother you, then you'll probably like this. Otherwise, I'd recommend \"Udder Cream\". It's very good from really dry skin and is unscented and unsparkly.",
    "There are some ups and some downs of nba live of 2004. First of all, when you take the ball upcourt, you are sometimes met by a player and you can not get around them. You always have to pass it to another player. Second of all, you can never pick it off when the other team passes it in. You can be standing right in front of the player the ball is going to and you can press and press the steal button to no effect. The upside to the game is the awesome dunking. I'm glad to see that someone at EA Sports knows what it takes to make people buy their products. One last thing: One thing that pisses me off is that when you throw an alley-oop pass, when the player that is supposed to be dunking it is guarded, he always misses the dunk. I have to yell out loud when that happens. Overall, it's a pretty good game.",

    "It seems that to have the machine fit snugly in this case, you should keep the original packaging materials. This may have been communicated somewhere, but I missed it. I believe this case will fit perfectly over the machine packed in its styrafoam surround. I am going to up the product rating from a 2 to a 3 because the case will do its job to keep the machine safe IF you have that packing material. It would be very safe to ship the machine in that configuration. I, however, tossed the machine's packaging the day before as the machine arrived before the case. Unless you pack some fabric or other material in the case, the machine is going to slip and slide around. Luckily, I had some extra fabric to stuff around the sides, but still felt I had to be extra careful moving the case. I also find the case difficult to snap together. Again, it seems to me that original styrafoam packaging would \"push\" the sides of the top out to fit perfectly with the bottom. Since I don't have that, I have to play with it a bit. I love the machine, but not the case. If I actually use it a lot, I will likely replace the case.",
    "I bought KMS because I was looking for something to hold and at the same time nurture my hair. It contains olive oil and I read a couple of rave reviews of it, so it is the one I chose. Would I buy it again? Probably not. It doesn't hold the hair as well as sculpting paste does (although that paste does not contain olive oil) and it is easy to apply too much, which is a disaster (makes the hair look weeks' unwashed and then is rather hard to wash out, as well). The reviewer I read was also really favorably impressed by the scent of KMS. Of course our senses are about as subjective as you can get, but I am not so favorably impressed by its scent.I really like the fact that KMS contains olive oil, and I will continue to look for products that nurture hair while doing whatever it is one bought them for.",

After blowdrying my hair I put a little bit of Redken outshine 01, spray a little TreSemme heat tamer, and start sectioning my hair to straighten it.

Yeah right. I ordered the hair butter along withCarol's Daughter Mimosa Hair Honey, 8 oz.and I just want to sing from the rooftops how pleased I am. I used about a quarter-sized dollop, as well as a tiny bit of the hair honey, after wringing my hair out post-shower and I let my hair air dry as normal. Holy cow, my hair is awesome!! It's soft, shiny (neither of which happen often) and the curls are tighter and lighter than I've ever known. This product is probably not best for those with fine or straight hair, and the scent is strong and could be off-putting to some (though I love earthy scents and I loved the smell of this). Next time I'll probably use a little less of both only because they're a bit expensive for my college student budget.

    "I got this mic about a year ago and have been using it with a Presonus Firebox and Logic 7 to record vocals, acoustic guitar, and mic'ing electric guitar played through a Vox AC15 tube amp. Thus far I am happy with this mic. In terms of sound, it is good for vocals, giving a really nice sound with very low noise. After I have tweaked the EQ in Logic to give a boost to the mid-range frequencies, and put a bit of reverb on them, the vocals come out sounding very nice.I've used poor quality mic's for recording for a long time, always thinking that an expensive mic would be out of my budget, since I just do casual home recording. But a friend of mine told me that nowadays there are mic's in the 200 dollar range that can come close to those that are 1000 dollars or more. I'm not sure about that since I haven't done the comparisons myself, but I can say that this is far and beyond better than anything I have ever used before. Not just the sound quality, but the look and build of the mic are very solid and professional. I like the fact that it comes with a suspension holder and a nice bag to hold and protect the mic.If this is slightly above your budget level, I would suggest checking out Shure SM 57 as a great all-purpose dynamic mic.EDIT: One year later, after building up my studio more and comparing this mic with a few others in its price range, and slightly cheaper, I would say that this mic is a bit brighter and harsher on vocals than some other options. I'm now preferring an Apex 205 ribbon mic or a Shure SM57 or 58 for vocals (both available for $80-90). They are both warmer than this mic for vocals, and more pleasing for my voice, at least! I'm now looking for alternative condenser mic's to replace this one with. However, for two years, it did serve me well!",

So far, I've not have any problems with any of the ones from Klean Kanteen. I have never noticed any metallic taste with the water even when it sits in there for a day or two, nor any other odors of any kind and I'm pretty sensitive to impurities in water from using water purifiers for well over a decade. I've used other cheaper, generic brands and with those I do notice a metallic taste, especially after the water sits for a few hours and will now only use Klean Kanteen.The quality of this brand is the best that I've encountered so far and I highly recommend it.

Advanced and beginning birders will benefit from the examples. The range maps have been adjusted in several cases. Sibley has taken great care in producing the most up-to-date field guide.The accompanying text is very informative. It is packed with information about each species. Sibley &quot;Guide to Birds&quot; definitely shows that years were taken to produce this comprehensive reference.If there is a downside, this book is heavy.

He stacks them together to see how much he can stack, he rolls them, and he throws them. No problem with me. At his age, he still has alot of experimenting and exploring to do. I point out the colors of the pegs to him also. So this item could be used in many ways. My 7 year old daughter now, she actually uses the board. She made a table, and she made a few letters.

You may have to condition the skin of the ball, by wetting it, in order to achieve a better grip as the skin is fairly slick right out of the box. Also, the instructions on the ball say to inflate at 10-12 pounds, but if you do this you'd better have the large hands of a Manning or McNair in order to get a grip, because it'll be as hard as a rock. For tossing the pigskin with friends I suggest inflating only to about 8-10 pounds so that your fingers can put a decent indent on the skin and give you better control.",

I still charged over night. It was the same. I noticed a little darkening on end of the tubes. So I bought new ones. Same thing. So I took the bulbs out and trashed the lantern.My new Coleman Quad from Amazon.com arrived yesterday.",
    "Agree with previous reviewer (Samuel). Current gloves are the Black/Grey/Yellow ones, instead of the Black/Grey/White as pictured. Gloves work very well with the silicon gel pads. Palm pads are sized to not *frumple* up when the hand is balled into a fist. Been using the gloves chipping and scraping concrete on concrete with SDS-max rotary hammer with a bull-point and 3 inch wide chipper. Helps greatly in reducing vibration fatigue in the hands and arms. Outside the silicon gel pads, the gloves have very limited protection against hard bumps and bruises from smacking hard, solid things like bricks and wooden posts.Purchased this more for the anti-vibration function and not sure how sturdy it is when cleaning up concrete debris. Using this pair as a tool glove rather than a cleanup glove. Just feel that true pigskin can handle scruffs, slashes, and stabs much better than non mil-spec composite materials.",

    "I love being able to do different craft items with my kids and when I saw this product, it seemed like it had interesting potential. I had used printable iron-on transfers before, and while they were fine for limited use, they just did not have the look I would want for some item, like a tote bag or apron.This package is 5 sheets of printable cotton backed with heat seal fabric. The packaging says that you can sew this on also, but since I used the whole sheet at once, I didn't see that happening. I decided to try the transfer on a canvas tote bag. I made my photo full-sized, did a draft quality test print on paper, and decided that it looked good. I then printed the picture onto the transfer at a higher quality set at normal paper setting. When it came off of the printer, I was surprised at how nice my picture printed. It had the look of a canvas painting, giving it a little bit of softness and texture without sacrificing the sharpness of the photo. I was very happy. I let the page sit overnight because the directions were not clear about how long the drying time should be, though it did not appear that it would smudge, even fresh from the printer. When I was ready to apply the transfer, I trimmed the little bit of the edge that was not printed on with a scrapbooking trimmer, though scissors would work fine. I then cropped the corners to round them. No problems, it handled just like heavy paper. Finally, I laid the tote bag on my ironing board, centered the transfer on the bag, and ironed it (no steam, cotton setting) for a minute or so, though it only calls for five seconds. The adhesive set nicely with no glue leaking out of the sides and no lumpiness. The edges adhered well, with no lifting. My kids were amazed that I'd made, not bought, the bag. We are very pleased with the results.I could picture using this on other items like a canvas apron, a canvas storage cube, or the insert says album covers, pillows, quilts, etc. I would not be afraid to try this on a more meaningful project now that I saw how nice the results are and have a feel for the process. The directions say these are washable (you must wait 24 hours though) but you should apply to the surface before the surface has been washed. They recommend hand washing separately in cold water, no chlorine bleach, and lay flat to dry.I would recommend this for a fun project with very nice results. I got quality results with ease of use. I was very pleased and impressed even though I frequently do projects like this.",
    "I only received the calipers a couple days ago but already they have proven to be a great investment.The entire unit feels sturdy and well made. I can't tell if it's steel or another hardened metal but it does not feel like aluminum. The display is very easy to read w/ large numbers. My only complaint is the display is constantly flashing the numbers while it's active/powered, which is slightly annoying at first. Otherwise, all of the button options (scale/zero) work wellThe plastic case is great for protection when not in use. The only issue was I had to trim out a slight corner of foam to get the calipers to fit properly.I am certainly glad I went with the 12\" versus the 6\" Avenger. You never know when the extra capacity will help.Overall - GREAT DEAL!",

    "These knives are a bit heavier than you might expect if you're a seasoned thrower. Requires a little bit refining on technique to get it right. But once you have that down you can drill a target rather consistently. I have managed to become competent throwing left and right handed with these knives. They require you to grip towards the rear of the handle more of the traditional full hand grip. At least that is my personal experience. My throwing distance for a half spin is around 8 feet from my target. Throwing at a human sized quarter sheet of 3/4 ply. I have since gone to a 6x6 in. post which is an easy target to consistently hit. They are stainless steel so they can take a lot of abuse. But do not be detracted when they get nicks in the blades this is inherent of throwing knives it will happen with any knife if you throw them enough just be prepared for it. Other say their knives broke personally I have not had that issue. Maybe they got a lemon but I have thrown them pretty hard and have hit them on each other with no ill effects. I believe this will be a good knife for anyone seasoned thrower or beginner. I have no complaints",
    "I have been sewing for overfourty years ,and so I am aquainted with sewing machines starting with my grandmother's treadle White to my current Viking.My Viking had to go for its yearly tension repair so I was left ( not very happily , I might add) in the middle of a project that required a lot of straight and zigzag stitching ..... I decided to buy a good BACKUP machine.I read the reviews and checked the Consumer Report (March 2009) and found the Brother XL2600I. I decided that if the reviews were correct then this was exactly what I was looking for....and it was and is. This is a great little basic machine. The stitches are uniform, the tension is amazingly perfect , and the instructional manuel is EASY to understand . This machine allows the project to be the focus of the sewing experince.The price is exceptioanl for the quality of the product.Good buy.",

    "First let me say I have 100 mics, 50 speakers, and 30 amps for Pro Sound, DJ and PA rentals and been doing pro sound for almost 50 years. 75% of all my equipment is Electro-voice and have never been let down by an EV mic, amp, mixer or speaker. I have been let down big time during perfomances by Mackie, Carvin, Crown, Peavey, Community, etc.There are times (mostly out of town gigs) where the situation changes and I'm forced to buy equipment in an emergency, and if the local dealer does'nt stock Electro-voice, I take whatever is available. That's how I ended up with two Yamaha P5000s amps. (Yamaha is my second choice after Electro-voice.)If you don't put too much emphasis on these first three cons, these amps may be ideal for you.Con #1. The speaker outputs are both speakon and 1/4 jacks which at first seems to be a good thing. However,the 1/4 jacks are not true \"jacks\" as we know them. They are a plastic barrels mounted on a printed circuit board. If you,a guest, or a waiter/waitress gets tangled in the speaker cord, these plastic tubes break very easily.This has happened to once-in-a-lifetime renters on several of my other Yamaha amps (EMX 88S, EMX860ST).Con #2 The power cord is hard wired instead of the typical computer power cord. Again at first, looks like a good a idea until you realize it's an 18 gauge cord. UL does'nt allow 18 gauge extension cords anymore because offires when people use them for heaters, toasters, hair dryers etc.Even all of my microphone cords are 20 gauge which is the next step up from 18 gaugeFor an extra 25 cents, Yamaha could haveused a 14 gauge cord (or 16 gauge at the minimum). I will replace the 18ga cord with a 14ga cord when thewarranty expires. (I assume the Yamaha engineers have never been at the end of four hundred feet ofelectrical extensions begging for every volt & ampere, or been plugged into a generator also operatinga moon bounce, beer truck, and tent heater only having 90 volts available.)Con #3 The extra large front handles are eye appealing, until you try to mount the amp in a road case. The handlesstick out way to far and you can't use the cover of the road case. The handles cannot easily be removedwithout violating the warranty. Looks like you have to disassemble the top, bottom and front to gain accessto the screws holding the handles. A bum design.Pro #1 The reason Yamaha is my second choice after EV is the design of their limiter. I have other non-EVand non-Yamaha amps that leave an audible drop out when the limiter activates. It may only be tenths ofa second, but the audience can detect the drop out. The P5000S limiters act flawlessly. There is nointerupption in the music, no pressure wave sent out when they release, and you can't really tellwhen the limiters activate other than by looking at the signal leds.Pro #2 The mode switch on the rear which allows you to operate CHAN A full range and CHAN B for subs, orCHAN A&B; for mains, or CHAN A&B; for subs with a frequency control which allows you to control thesignal sent to the subs.Pro #3 Recessed and detented front gain controls which are protected from damage and quite accuratewhen setting CHAN A&B; to the same output level.Pro #4 Twin fans, pure sound, impeccable inside wiring, switching power supply (no massive toroidal transformers),relativeley light weight per watt.Pro #5 Removable clear plastic anti-tampering windows which cover the front gain controls when you want to seta certain level and don't want anyone monkeying with the knobs. Easliy removed with a suppliedwrench.Pro #6 A seemingly minor point, but they include a cover for the rear 5-way binding post/banana jack panel.May not seem important until you understand where once-in-a-lifetime renters try to plug things in.Conclusion - in my opinion, if Yamaha spent $2.00 for a better power cord, Switchcraft speaker jacks instead ofplastic tubes, and easily removable handles, I would give the P5000S a glowing perfect rating.But until then, I say 3.0 mostly because of potential catastrophic failure of the 1/4 plastic speaker jacks (tubes/barrels)Renters always get 1/4 cables anymore. They don't know how to use speakons. I've gottenamps back with two 50 foot cables wrapped around the amp because they forgot how to remove the speakonconnectors.I'll be modifying both amps as soon as the warranty expires to change the power cord, remove thehandles, and install metal Switchcraft speaker jacks.",

I was amazed at the sound quality. I didn't believe it was possible with just two 3 watt speakers. The voices very closely mimic the real instruments and the rythm sections are outstanding. It is easy to set the voice, tempos, and accompaniment. At twelve pounds, I can carry it without the possibility of getting a hernia. It is attractive, has quality sound and it was at at unbelievable low price. My only suggestion is that you increase the number of memory setups. Four is not enough.A very satisfied customer,Sam J.

    "I got three of these hangers and they're pretty awesome. I hung two acoustic guitars and my violin in my living-room and they all look quite handsome. You can pinch and widen the hook to fit most any instrument with a head on it. Aesthetically speaking, the hooks look really great and match the wood-grain on the guitars nicely. The mounts have a nice neutral finish to them that makes them a very flexible decorating accessory. The guitars are safe, out of the way, look nice and they really complete the room. The guitars aren't touching the wall (which keeps them blissfully free of scratches and paint marks), the mounts are sturdy and well made and they are easy to install. Just find a stud and go nuts, baby. There's also minimal damage to the walls since the mount just uses two long, thin screws. Overall the mount saves space, looks great, doesn't damage the walls heavily, and is sturdy and safe. :) Great buy!",
    "I first saw a cajon in a church band and was impressed at the sound such a small box could make. I checked the local music stores' collection of cajons. While there were some that could put out more bass sound, or had adjustment knobs for the snare string mechanism, or were even had amplifiers, the Meinl Headliner served our purpose for the best price. The Headliner comes with a hex wrench to adjust the snare string tension from below. The faceplate can also be adjusted with a phillips screwdriver. We are amateur musicians and play at home for our family. The cajon makes a wonderful simple percussion instrument that anyone can play--even the kids. It is also makes a good seat for playing other instruments.",
    "Bought this scope for a scout setup on a Mosin Nagant and am really happy with the purchase so far...even though it says AO (adjustable objective) and it really isn't. Not the first time Amazon has misrepresented a product in the description. Not a big deal for me, but something to take note of.The long eye relief is perfect, the optics are really clear and crisp, and the materials feel like quality. My main complaint with this scope is with the windage & elevation adjustments. Honestly, they leave a lot to be desired. They are not \"fingertip\" adjustable by an stretch as you have to use a coin or a straight-slot screwdriver to make the adjustments. Even then it's hard to turn and is a real pain in the butt. The clicks feel a little mushy, too, but not horrible. Overall, it's a good quality scope with adjustments that could be much better, but I still highly recommend it for the price point.",

The whole point of \"Peeling\" is to clear away the old dead skin cells and allow new ones to surface. It takes your skin (depending on age) 20-42 days for brand-new skin cells to work their way up to the surface of the epidermis, if your constantly stripping your damaging your new skin cells. Patience is needed with peels and generally a series of 4-6 are needed depending on your expectations. Always apply spf of 30 or more afterward and before starting with this 50% lactic prime your skin a week before by using 2-5% glycolic wash. And PLEASE seek the advice of your friendly neighborhood dermatologist and/or esthetician before even attempting to peel.Good luck to you all.**Oh and regardless of what the manufacturer claims it does not change the \"size\" of your pores, they may appear smaller because the chemical de-congests the follicle but if you naturally have big pores; this will not shrink them.",

My only wish is that it had a higher percentage of glycolic acid. Even though it's not made for the face I have used it on my face at the most two times a week as I didn't want to irritate my skin. Overall, this is a great product for those that want clear and smooth skin.",
    "As we all know, washing our favorite canine friend can be a challenge at times as they don't always cooperate. For years I have been using products that I could find at my local pet shop and they have all been liquid shampoo allegedly formulated for a \"dog's sensitive skin\". The problem is that it takes a lot of shampoo and associated effort to get all the parts properly cleansed. On the one hand, my dog, a mini schnauzer, keeps moving so the shampoo I have just squeezed out onto my palm and am desperately trying to distribute to his chest or rear leg is dripping and even when I get it where it needs to be it never seems to be enough. I find myself using a lot of liquid shampoo to do the job and the constant need to pick up the bottle or pump more onto my hand gives my pooch an opportunity to try to get away from me further complicating the task. In the end, I use a lot of shampoo to get this relative small, long haired dog clean. Another issue for me is the smell of dog shampoo as most of them are overly scented and artificial smelling.I had often wished that I could find a bar of soap specially formulated for a canine that is not overly scented and leaves their coat nice and shiny. Well, this soap does it and does it well. When using a bar of soap there is no need to keep going back to the bottle to get more as you have all you need right in your hand. Washing the dog with this product takes a lot less time and it rinses out completely with ease. I can get my dog washed in just a few minutes and as I always have one hand on the dog, he is easier to control and more cooperative.I first wet him down completely avoiding his head but getting every part of his body nice and wet. Then I take the bar of soap in my hand and get every part nicely lathered up which is easier with the source of soap firmly in your hand. I then rinse his entire body and then wet his head as that is the part he really doesn't like. I then soap up his beard/muzzle, neck and head avoiding his eyes and quickly rinse him off with a hand held sprayer protecting his nose from direct contact with the water. After one final rinse of his body he is wrapped in a large towel and happily rubs his face and body into it drying himself off. The smell of the soap is wonderful and mild with a hint of cinnamon and sage and it leaves his fur nice and shiny. Fortunately, it does not irritate his skin or cause flaking or itching so all in all, we are both happy with the product.So why only four stars? It is a rather small bar (only 3 oz) for the price and doesn't last too long, so you should buy a few at a time. Once you have tried it you will never go back to liquid shampoo again.",

Overall I'd recommend this set to a beginning quilter; it has all the tools you'd need to begin your first quilt and the quality is pretty great!",
    "This little thing is great so far. I even used it to pump up my motorcycle tire (just to see if it would work). While it did take a bit of effort and the pump does get a bit warm from friction, the bottom line is that it worked. Great little pump for the money.I even thought about buying another one for my motorcycle, and I still might, but I obviously cannot carry a spare motorcycle tire with me....I would just use it to \"top off\" my tires when needed.",
    "This is one of the first fabric landscape books I have purchased. It was clearly written, has beautiful photographs, and was a true inspiration for me. I have learned a lot from this book, and created several projects based on the ideas in the books.The book is well organized, and I have returned to it a number of times for some additional inspiration and ideas after the initial reading. This is always a sign that the book is very good!Chapter 1. Getting started. This chapter talks about general techniques such as useful tools, adding borders, cutting, glueing, design walls, etc.Chapter 2. Creating your own landscape quilt. This chapter has step by step instructions of creating the book cover quilt \"Black eyed susan\" and two others. The basic techniques in these chapters are a great foundation on doing your own designs.Chapter 3. Adding Garden accessories. This chapter talks about adding other elements to your art work, such as picket fences.Chapter 4. Cutting free-form shapes. This chapter concentrates on cutting and design, includes a number of beautiful examples.Chapter 5. Creating woodland scenes. This chapter covers doing tree landscapes. Trully beautiful, one of my favorite chapters for inspiration.Chapter 6. Creating Water, Sky, Mountains, and Snow. The title of the chapter is very descriptive, it teaches techniques, gives ideas, and has many examples.Chapter 7. Finishing touches. This chapter talks about embellishments, such as machine embroidery, ribbon embroidery, three dimensional appliqu&eacute;, and so forth.I highly recommend this book. It teaches and it inspires.",
    "I've had problems with both oily and dry facial skin since my high school years, and finding the right products to deal with them hasn't always been easy, particularly for the dry skin issue.I've tried many products, ranging from cocoa butter to Curel or generic moisturizers; they've helped some, but I hate the cold goopy feeling of the moisturizers -- especially in cool weather -- and I sometimes forget to apply them. Moreover, I still have to wash my face at least twice a day; if I use regular soap for a long stretch of time I'll get these terrible dry skin patches. Worse, if my skin is red and blotchy from stress, the soap will burn.Thankfully, Nivea For Men's Double Action Face Wash has proven to be an effective solution to most of my problems. It is gentle on my sensitive skin and cleans off dirt and oil (I still get oily skin when I'm stressed, too) without irritating or burning, and if used dilligently and in conjunction with Nivea For Men's other products (Exfoliating Scrub, After Shave Balm), the Double Action Face Wash soothes and moisturizes the dreaded red-and-dry patches of skin. In time, those ugly patches start diminishing in size and will eventually vanish. Even better, its scent is pleasant yet masculine, with none of that heavy soapy smell that lingers for hours.",
    "This ink has impressed me in many ways.When you first hold it the glass bottle is of high quality. It feels sturdy and strong and doesn't feel like a cheap bottle. The print though does seem a little tacky on this bottle.Regarding the ink, it proves to be one of the most versatile products I have used. It does what it avertises, which is a big positive.",
    "First, the good news. The rack went on well, no small issue because I have disk brakes, and needed a wide rack. It is sturdy as can be, and I have no qualms about loading it to the gills.Now the bad news. These are great racks IF you want to do what TOPEAK thinks you should do with your bike. Sadly, topeak and I disagree. So, I tried to mount my open top city panniers to the rack. The rack tubing is too thick. OK, I can modify that. So, I think I would like a narrow trunk rack so I can use my shopping panniers and still have a zipped space to store my raincoat etc. etc. I tried going to a brick and mortar store to actually look at the trunk racks and try them and see if they'll fit. The answer \"Topeak has changed their system so often we no longer carry them. We can special order, but thats it.\" Oh well, no trunk rack for me I guess. Finally I thought perhaps I would mount a flasher on the back of my rack. Two choices here. Buy the proprietary Topeak back lights, or take a hack saw to the rack to modify it.My recommendation find a company that makes racks and doesn't try to be overly clever.",

    "Over all just a little bit too slick for my liking. Without a doubt it was great to see them play again, but if I had a say in the matter they would have used the same amps, guitars, and basses from the old days. (I know Jack says they tried that approach in rehearsals but \"didn't like it\") I found Jack's hi tech bass rig sounded too clean, and was under mixed. I thought the drums sounded fabulous as did Ginger's drumming. That brings me to Eric, sigh...would it have killed him to strap on a Gibson for some of these songs? The Strat sounded good on stuff like \"Badge\", and a couple of others, but \"Crossroads\"?... c'mon! That's like playing \"Whole Lotta Love\" on a banjo. I have to echo what others have said here about song selection on the DVD, No \"Tales of Brave Ulyses\", but we get \"Stormy Monday\"...that ain't right! Oh, and \"White Room\": Eric, the wah wah is that long skinny black pedal on the floor beside the Leslie switch.",

In 2 years of heavy use on all the bicycles, I had to replace one tube.

There are just so many choices and sizes. Jergens just happens to make the sizes I wanted in stainless and aluminum without me needing to do a custom order. Got these in and they blew me away with their quality. I've bought some other quick lock pins in the past but they could not hold up to the applications I was using them in. These do a great job and also look good as well. A little pricey but worth it. For my application their strength is more than sufficient and everything else is a bonus. I ordered 2 and it looked like they came from different vendors since the packaging was completely different, but the items in the packaging were identical. Recommended if this size fits your application.",

One warning though: the little mushroom / fingers are VERY easily bent just by pressing on them with your finger (for example: trying to stick down the adhesive to a surface). They deform and don't move back into place. If your application isn't semi-permanent, you are better off with another type of (more durable) velcro.",
    "This is a very nice dart board with many games to keep you entertained. It has 4-player simultaneous scoring. It shows green when a number is hit once, yellow/orange for twice, and red for 3 times. It flashes red when the number is closed out and should no longer be hit. It allows 8 players, alternating between the first 4 and second 4.The only gripe was that the Bulls-Eye spun when hit, so it would rotate down and neutralize the impact. This would sometimes cause it to not register. Otherwise, great board!",

I can now do the bigger jobs around the house without always having to stop and unclog the hose. It also helps shorten the amount of time it takes me to do these jobs since the shop-vac can pickup more stuff quicker since the hose is bigger!Now that I have the perfect Shop-Vac accessory kit, I really need to purchase a larger capacity shop-vac so I don't have to stop working so many times to empty out the shop-vac.

    "I use three of these and am buying a fourth. Two are bi-amping a $40,000 stereo mastering system in my studio. These replaced a finiky pair of class A power amps whose paint cost more than these entire amps.The sound quality is ruthless and musical as hell. I did have to recalibrate the way I had my monitor speakers aimed, because every amp works a speaker response and delivery its own way. However these amps told me more truthfully where the speakers needed improvement setup wise...Before you think I am mad let me add I used to be a Krell salesman and McIntosh Labs salesman. I know power amps. My front end is all class A. I studied the topology of these amps and concluded they just might be a \"sleeper\" in the design department as they use SMDs and a bunch of HiFi tricks.Plus they are freakin loud and clean and never blow drivers with unlimited clean power... Unlike my Class A amps which blew up a monitor when they choked.I am finally buying another one to actually use as a PA amp and make an honest amp out of it. I would not say there are no other \"deals\" to be found out there in the world of commercial sound re-inforcement. The only other design that excited me was the Crown K series which I believe is discontinued. So this was the best I could find four years ago.Try them. You may like them...",

    "We purchased this grill as a gift for my husband. He was looking for a smaller grill as we have a large one already. This is perfect! Not only was it the right size but it's portability made it even better. We also purchased the Coleman RoadTrip Cast-Iron Griddle which is great to cook fish, steak and cheese, grilled cheese, or anything that might fall through the regular grill.As we were planning to leave this standing much of the time near our pool the bag for it was unnecessary. The cover offered on here would have worked, but was a bit pricey. Instead we found that a simple kettle grill cover from Wal-Mart for under $10 fits PERFECTLY! We also found it much more economical to purchase a hose w/ fittings from Lowes and connect the grill directly to a large propane tank. No need to worry about smaller tanks running out if you're going to use it in one place much.Having used the grill several times now we are completely sold. As for a small portable gas grill it is perfect since it stands up, not table top. Also the gril rarely flames up and the grill plates wash excellently, even in the dishwasher.We highly recommend!",

    "I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews of this serger. Because of the reviews, I decided to buy the Brother that is priced similarly but with better reviews. However, I had a gift card to Joann and this was the only serger they sold, so I ended up getting this one figuring I could return it if it was as bad as the reviews say.I was pleasantly surprised to take it out of the box and immediately begin serging. It came already threaded and ready to go. I had no serging experience and it took less than 2 minutes to figure out how to start. After a week or so of regular use, a thread broke. I figured, \"Here it comes. Here comes the part everyone is complaining about.\" I looked at the manual and it took just a few minutes to rethread the broken thread and start serging again. Again, I cannot figure out what everyone is complaining about.For a final test before I wrote this review, I decided to unthread and then rethread the whole machine. It wasn't that it was that hard, it was tricky to thread the needles, but really it wasn't that big of deal using the tweezers that the machine came with. Honestly, I found threading my regular sewing machine for the first time more challenging when I first began sewing than I did puzzling out how to thread this serger. So I'm very pleased with this purchase. It serges well and is easy to use, so I'm happy.EDITED 1/13/12The tension got wonky after a few months, and I haven't been able to use it. I had a friend who is quite experienced with sergers look at it, and she wasn't able to adjust the tension to get it working properly again. So it's just been sitting on my sewing table collecting dust. I will probably take it to get serviced, but I hate to shell out the money to have it serviced when it is still so relatively new. However, I haven't come up with any better options. As a result, I'm knocking off a couple of stars because it only really functioned well for a few months.EDITED 12/9/12I did take it to a repair shop and spent $65 to get it serviced. It has worked fine since then. If I had to do it over again, I would have bought a different brand, but that being said, after servicing, this serger has worked fine again.",

    "Length:: 9:59 MinsI got the Behringer XENYX 1202FX so I could achieve better quality and extendable audio abilites that my PC alone could not provide. I primarily use my mixer for podcasting and youtube video creation. The mixer allows me to connect 4 mono audio input devices like MICs, and upto 4 stereo audio input devices and control the levels for each input device to mix into a cohesive output sound.You could easily hook up the Master Output to an amp, powered speakers, or to your PC's Sound LINE IN if you want. However, I do not use the Master Output much at all. Instead, I hook up the provided CD/TAPE INPUT/OUTPUT connections to a Berhinger UCA222 USB Audio Interface. This gives me a much better sound that my PC equipped sound card. So using the UCA222 on a system that already has a sound card, expands your system to have 2 sound card devices.To have your PC software receive audio from your mixer thru the UCA222, you need to make sure you configure your software to choose the USB as your sound source for recording. If you don't use the UCA222 or similar device, and instead just hook up the mixer to your PC's sound card LINE IN, then there's nothing you need to configure on your PC.I love this mixer. I can connect my iPhone to one of the stereo INPUTS, a professional MIC to one of the MONO inputs, and whatever other audio devices I want to add on such as a CD Player, an MP3 Player, even the output from a PC Sound card.I highly recommend this mixer. Behringer has other models - some much more robust, and others far simpler. ou can get an idea what is available on their site",

All of these signify romance, which is most definitely appropriate for this subtly sensuous fragrance.Princess Marcella Borghese launched this scent in 1993 and like all classics it has withstood the test of time. Its floral fragrance is as fresh today as it was when introduced.

After I made my first rag quilt using traditional scissors and suffering extreme hand soreness for days, I knew I had to do something different for my future quilts. Since I've started a little rag quilting business, I ordered two different scissors to make sure I always had scissors to clip my quilts and the other scissors stopped working after one and a half lap-sized quilts. But, so far these Fiskars have not failed me & after 6 quilts within the last few weeks, they are still going strong. They did start to catch a little on my last quilt, but my husband adjusted the screw by the blade and they were good as new. If you plan to make more than one rag quilt, I would definately invest in these because your hands will thank you!",
    "The Brother XL2600I is a great machine. I have yet to put it to extreme testing but have sewed on it and love the way is works, the easy threading or the machine and the bobbin. The many stitches are great. The only concern I have are the directions. They are poorly put together and read horribly.",

    "I must vehemently disagree with the aforementioned review. I found this CD to be simply an abomination. I don't know what he was listening to, but as far as I'm concerned, it is without question among the worst of the worst of Naxos' very large repertoire. When I bought this CD, I was quite hopeful. I thought that Naxos had eradicated the mediocrity found in many of its earlier recordings. (And the label's recent price hike also raised my expectations). Theodore Kuchar and the National Symphony Orchestra of the Ukraine have made several brilliant recordings for the Naxos label, foremost among them being Kalinnikov's two magnificent symphonies. THAT performance is virtually unassailable. So here is the short list of the many problems which I encountered with this CD.1. The sound and recording quality is ghastly. Throughout the whole CD, I needed my CD player's volume on max just to hear anything. Even then I would say well over 1/3 of the Capriccio Italien is inaudible.2. The tempo and spacing of all the pieces is decidedly to slow. Kuchar has managed to take these masterpieces and turn them into lumbering hulks. When listening to them I honestly had images in my mind of an old tired train sputtering with all its might up a hill that it will ultimately fail ascend.3. Finally the performances on the whole are underwhelming at best. I must particularly point to the 1812 Overture. It is pathetic endeavor. It's literally one step up from a second rate high school band. The cannon's were for me the greatest sadness here. They sound like someone popping a paper bag full of air. I have heard this piece live with real cannons, and these do not compare. Some may call this nit-picking, but for me, it irrevocably compromised the integrity, and majesty that this piece should have.So once more, DON'T BE FOOLED by the cheap price tag. These compositions are ageless masterpieces. If you have never heard them before, don't let this recording be your first experience with them, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. Rather spend a little more, and get a decent recording and a decent performance. Virtually ANY OTHER one available is superior.I rarely get this angry over a CD.2 THUMBS WAY WAY DOWN",
    "Do you have cats? Do you have breakable items that you would like to display? Are you afraid of your cat vindictively knocking over said items? Fear no more!! I have 2 Bengals and have used this stuff for picture frames, vases, candle holders, and other fragile knick-knacks for the past 5 years. It does not damage or leave marks on furniture and the cats show no interest in the items stuck down by the substance once they realize they can't easily knock them over.This stuff is NOT for use on walls but for holding down objects on horizontal surfaces. It is also stiff and not very tacky out of the package. You need to pull of a piece and manipulate it with your hands. Once the stuff is warmed up, it gets softer and tackier. At this point you affix to the object in question and the surface. It will cool and stick to the surface just fine. You can always re-position later. You just use mild force to remove the object from the surface, remove the putty, warm up the putty, and move to new location. If you do it right, it is not noticeable at all. I highly recommend this for any cat owner with fragile belongings.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.",

    "I work for a hospital and present health education programs out in the community. I need a sound system that is portable, yet fairly powerful and easy to use. I originally purchased the predecessor to this sound system about 7 years ago, and had nothing but trouble with it. I decided to purchase this new model, hoping that improvements had been made. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. I often check to make sure it works before I go out into the field, but when I set up it doesn't work. The batteries are new, but it won't turn on. Sometimes if you play around with the battery pack and push it into position (it often pops out as there are 10 batteries to jam into the space) it will work. Also,nomatter how I position myself and the case, I get a lot of feedback. Sometimes it's the microphone that doesn't work even though new batteries have been used. Very frustrating. We spent over $1,000 on 2 of these products, and don't have a workable sound system. Stay away from this one!",

These must be the heaviest bongos you can buy. With this stand, I am able to brace them firmly. I can hit them as hard as I need to and thanks to the stand's build and weight, there's no sway or movement. What I am trying to say, in a few words, this is a very solid stand and I did no have to make any special changes to it to work perfectly with my LP's. If you have a different brand of bongo, I cannot comment as to the fit but the bracket is universal and should work well with pretty much any type of bongos.Compared to other stands I considered (online), this is a very solid buy at a very aggressive price.",

The first one happened just within the 90 day warranty, and we were able to send to official center 60 miles away. That problem was clearly a manufacturing defect where a part came loose inside. This second problem is the actual sewing is now not correct. Appears to be a tension problem, but everything appears ok. At this point, we are on the edge of buying a new machine that is more robust. I will wait and see what the shop says tomorrow. Could cost us more to fix it than it's worth. Timing is terrible, as my wife started a class two days ago. The reliability of this product is unacceptable. Very unhappy. (Are all the new machines plastic now? Miss the old metal units and metal bobbins).",

    "First off...There is NO other game that I am this picky about. My Madden gaming experience is important to me, because there is no other game that dominates my free time like Madden does.Team Madden dropped the ball on this one.I'll be the first person asking for something new in the bells and whistles department...but DANG! When the bells and whistles get so loud that you can't hear the fun stuff going on behind `em, you have a problem. The championship ring thing is just ridiculous! If I ever see someone \"sporting\" one of those things, I'm calling `em out in public for being a world class loser. Seriously, to think you actually accomplished something by playing a video game is one huge indicator for a serious need for counseling. I mean...i like video games too, but get real.My beloved Franchise Mode is now so freaking involved that I hardly felt like bothering with it. Why mess up a good thing with a bunch of extra crap that you now have to track? I don't know anyone that wants to waste HOURS just setting up a game unless there's some incredible gameplay involved afterwards. And thats just it...there isn't even \"OK\" gameplay once you hit the field. I know I'm not the only person that still feels like my players are ice-skating down the sideline when I actually got a chance to break a long run, or feels like they're not really in control of their runningback inside. I just hit some buttons and pray...you don't set up cuts anymore on Madden, you just hope that things work out. That's lame EA!Save your money people! If you don't have a backwards compatible PS3...get one. Then buy Madden 08 for PS2. You'll get a more natural feel to the gameplay, and thereby have a much more fun and satisfying gaming experience.PS,Don't get me started about how horrible the defensive side of the ball feels on this rip-off of a game!",

    "The roll of canvas arrived in the factory box/packaging which was fully in tact and not damaged in any visible way. The roll inside once opened and started to be fed into the plotter had two tears in the middle of the canvas sheet about 1\" long each and about 2 feet into the roll. The only explanation I can come up with is that it was put into the box this way as the box appears to be in perfect shape, the plastic wrap on the roll was not damaged in any visible way. To lose 2+ feet off a 20 foot roll is quite a bit of lost material/money. That's why I only gave it 4 stars. I've had glossy paper arrive with tape on the gloss surface which also damaged the first foot or so.Other than that initial flaw, the canvas works perfectly for inkjet plotting of photos so far in an HP Z6100.",

    "I ended up returning it, and taking it from a four-star review down to a three-star. Why?It boils down to the pickup selector switch. I mentioned in the original review that it was badly positioned, and I found that I was constantly hitting the switch with my picking hand while playing. And since I generally play with the neck pickup selected, this meant that I was constantly having my playing interrupted by an abrupt change in tone. In addition to being badly-positioned, the switch itself is too easy to flip -- it takes only a light touch to move it out of position.It's a shame because in most other respects the guitar was great, but that pickup switch was a deal breaker.---------------------------------------------------------------I needed a plain-jane Telecaster-style guitar with some tonal flexibility (humbucker/single-coil switch), a comfortable neck, and a quality build. After doing a lot of research and considering the Fender Blacktop Tele, I chose the Schecter PT. It arrived quickly, in good shape, and with a great set-up (the guitar is Korean-made, but is set up by the Schecter guys in their L.A. factory, and they did a fine job).The build is tight and clean. Frets are smooth and polished, body laquer is evenly applied, and the attractive cream binding is flawless as far as I can tell. Action is fairly low (though not too low), and the controls all seem solid. Pickups sound good, though a bit beefy (even for humbuckers). Single-coil tone is very Tele-like. The guitar is a bit heavy, but that's the price you pay for playing a Tele-style axe.One gripe: I wish the pickup switch were further offset, because it's easy to hit it with your picking hand.So far, the Schecter PT is a good guitar for the money. It's plain, but attractive, and it has a quality of build and setup that's a little surprising at this price-point.",

I'm not sure if Prismacolor changed their pencils or if it is this particular pencil box. It did say Soft Core Colored Pencils so I was expecting them to be softer for an easier blend. BUT they are still very good quality and would recommend Prismacolor over any other brand.",
    "The items was original Powerwinch item, not all marine retail locations that sell the winch sell this item,This review is more about how great Amazon is than the item, the item is great, I found it on Amazon and it was shipped to my door in a few days.I had to replace the original item when I used the handle to assist the winch motor and realized to late the handle contacted the plug and cracked it.",
    "Humes & Berg are an adequate (if that) choice for the brass player lacking in coin, but I'd recommend saving up and buying something better. (Unless it's last minute.) One 'nice' thing about these mutes, is that they're widely available in most all music stores, if you need a mute on the fly. That said, don't expect nice sounds from these. I got one, when I needed a mute and had lost my other cup mute. I didn't enjoy using it, even as a backup. I don't even know what happened to mine. It's probably lying somewhere in my room.I've been playing trumpet for ten years, and let me say, I hate the sound these mutes produce. The straight mute, and the cup mute both produce tinny, raspy sounds. A good sound for a cup mute would be soft, feathery, and crisp. These mutes are tinny, tinny, and guess what? Tinny.I'd recommend the Denis Wick Adjustable cup/straight mute. While as a straight mute, the sound leaves a little something to be desired, (I use a Bach Elite for my straight mute) as a cup mute, the sound is simply great. I love my Denis Wick, and the fact the it's collapsible, (the cup portion comes off) it fits easily and neatly into my Strad case, where it is at home.There you have it. Keep this as a last resort, buy something better.",
    "The bag itself is great for the cymbals. However, the shoulder straps started failing at the top seam a few months after I received it. Poor quality strapping material and sewing in my opinion. I'm looking to have the straps reattached and reinforced at the top seam.",

    "I love these picks. The grip on the picks really does help you keep a hold of them as your playing. These are really thin though, so if you're looking for a firmer pick, try finding some thicker ones. The only issue I had was the product picture shows 6 different colors of picks, but then says Light Grey in the product description. Color isn't a big deal, but it would be nice for them to change the picture to match the product more precisely.",
    "LOVE this machine! Very easy to use and so quiet! I love the cassette that threads the machine and top loading bobbin. The embroidery part worked great the first time I used it. My favorite features would have to be the thread cutter and the ease of not using the foot pedal (although included). I think this is a great machine for beginners and those like myself who have been sewing for years!",
    "Overall, I was fairly happy with this product. The foam piece on the bottom part of the curler made it very gentle. I was thrilled that a replacement foam piece was included in the package. This curler didn't curl my lashes as well as others that I've used in the past, but I assume that it's because it was designed to be gentler on the lashes. I'd recommend this product to others.",

    "These goggles are very comfortable, don't leak and don't fog up. However, they broke after only 2 months of daily use. I had them in the car, picked them up at the destination and the nose strap looked like it was cut in the middle. No idea how this might have happened. But I still bought another pair as replacement. Another small thing: Every time I lift my head out of the water, a little water drop forms on the bottom outside rim of the glasses - slightly annoying.",

    "I'd first like to say that I bought this guitar on Amazon for about $65, a lot cheaper than it's being sold now (currently $111). It's a wonderful guitar for an inexpensive solidbody, but it looks a little different than the picture would lead you to believe. For one, the guitar doesn't have a \"finish,\" not even a glossy clearcoat -- it's solidbody wood, sanded smooth and given a deep wood stain. Secondly, the guitar is pictured as being much lighter in color than it actually is. The photo shows it looking almost like a red colored wood; in reality, it's a much darker, deep brown, akin to coffee.This does not, however, affect its playability, which is wonderful. I have a bit of buzzing on one fret, but that can easily be fixed with a good sanding and polish. The guitar can also be strung and tuned easily, though with any guitar of this body style you'll have to continually tune-and-retune until the strings will keep a tuning. It's a very heavy, sturdy guitar, and for a solidbody with two humbuckers you'll likely not find one that sounds as meaty and smooth.",
    "I highly recommend this sampler especially if you are new to machine embroidery. A wide range of colors to work with most projects.",
    "Was a bit disappointed when I received the item in the mail. Container holding the charcoal was tin-ny and cheap. I guess the contents themselves (pieces of charcoal, other pencils) were all fine- it's just that the presentation/box it came in was lacking. Also discovered that the outside cardboard and plastic packaging was damaged and partly opened. Made me question how reputable the company was- and why I didn't just go for a more recognizable brand (Faber Castell, Strathmore, etc). Disappointed since I was giving it as a gift. Ended up purchasing another set- post-Christmas, a Prisma-Color collection from Strathmore. The packaging/presentation was much nicer. I guess this set would have been fine- if you were looking to pay less money and didn't need it as a gift.",
    "What I ordered and what I received were two different products. I ordered Biosilk Finishing Spray Firm Hold - Hair Spray and received CHI Flex Hold Firm Hold Hair Spray. I chose not to return the product received because I thought I might as well try it, the price paid ended up a great sale for the amount of hair spray in the can. The CHI Flex Hold Hair Spray does not hold the hair style for as long a period of time as the Biosilk Firm Hold. I should have made contact with the seller to see why the product was switched or if the other product was no longer being manufactured. I will still make future purchases from Amazon.com and possibly this seller.",
    "Coverage was superb. We did not follow all the directions, such as patching the concrete, we just painted the divets. We're in an apartment and just flooded, and really didn't care about the gouges. Just needed a floor replacement and this was faster than what the apartment manager wanted to do for us.We ripped up carpeting to put this down, so there was considerable work involved, but it only took about 6 or 7 hours total from start to finish, not including dry time. This is a latex-type paint and does peel around the edges if it sticks to the tape at all, so use a razor blade when removing tape from the baseboards.Coverage was great. We opted not to use the paint chips as we thought it was a bit too 'desert cammo' looking for a bedroom. We waited the full 24 hours after final application to move furniture back into the room, but even being incredibly careful, we still scuffed the floor in a couple of places. Thankfully it's a scuff and not wanting to peel more like the baseboard areas are.I would use this product again, however, if I were needing something in a pinch.",
    "I bought this for a little office/crafts station I have set up in my bedroom. Space is a major premium, especially desk space since I don't have much, and what I do have I need for laying out pages to scrapbook. This little ingenious contraption keeps all of my gel pens, calligraphy pens, and scissors handy. I get into it a couple of times a day, not to mention how important it is to me when I'm scrapbooking or writing letters and using multiple pens. It's so easy to see all the pens and their various colours because of slots to hold the pens so each can be seen clearly.The tray is useful as a catch-all for miscellaneous beads, embellishments, etc. I use a lot of small embellishments often, and the trays keep them organized and accessible all while saving space.",
    "I wont say these are the best drill bits in the world, but they are good and get the job done.

Check Costco for a much lower price, but if you don't have a Costco in your area, or they don't have them anymore this price is about good as it gets.",

Quality satisfies and lasts forever.Thanks Fullerbrush",

    "I bought a 3 pack of Hohner Blues Harps.At first, they played alright, but after about a year some of the notes wouldn't play properly or it took a half second before the reed would activate, which doesn't make for really good music if you can't blow a note and have it play right away. The unit is not dirty, nor was it abused. I disassembled it and checked the reeds and they were clean. Some people swear by these, but 2 out of the 3 I bought were junk.",

    "I have 2 of these large shower caddy's in each bathroon. One I can put up high to keep my kids out of so they will quit wasting my shampoo and one lower for them. We moved and they were easy to remove and take to our new house. Another great thing, if it gets a lot of soap build up you can remove it from the hooks and is safe for the top shelf of the dishwasher. They have lasted me years, think I've had mine for at least 6 years and they have never fallen, not one of them, and I put our family size shampoo and conditioner bottles on them, one on each side. They have survived my children so I think they are great.",

These gloves do run small and I was glad to have read the review pointing me to buy the large size.",

That's probably a function of my baby, not the egg shaker. I got 3, yellow, blue and red, and he likes holding them. He really likes when I bang them together. They're tough for him to chew on but he tries and there are no teeth marks whatsoever. I think they're going to last a long time and I'm hoping he'll like them more once he realizes what they're for.",
    "I purchased 2 of these storage caddies for both of my showers off of Amazon (I searched all my local stores, and they didn't carry these). I read the reviews before I purchased it and was pleased to see all the positive feedback on this shower caddy. I think it's the perfect size shower caddy. Mine also came with an extra hook for holding your washcloth, or body wash poof. Instalation was easy. You need to let the tape set a day before installing the caddy to it. I've owned this now for about a month and haven't had any problems with it. I highly recommend this!!!!UPDATE: I have now had these up for 2 YEARS & They are still holding on strong! :) I highly recommend these shower caddies for extra storage room in your shower! GREAT BUY! Don't waste your money on the suction cup versions!",
    "UPDATE: After almost 2 years, we had a septic pumped this a.m. No problems re fat/grease or anything else that could be attributed to a disposal. In fact, there was a problem w too much liquid in the tank. The septic man said it would rectified by rinsing the septic filters every 6 mos. SO I say the InSinkerator passes muster! Definitely keeping the 5 star rating. The only thing that I wonder about is that the BioCharge does not go down very much and we've had same bottle in for 4 mos+. We replaced the one before it because I thought there might be something wrong w the container since that one was going down at such a slow rate, too. Anyone else have this same experience w BioCharge? It seems to be adding just it needs to dissolve or act on the fats/solids though because, as I said, there was no problem reported, and it had been TWO years since we last pumped.When we remodeled our kitchen a year ago we had the Insinkerator Evolution Septic Assist installed. We had lived 20 years without a disposal because of being on a septic system. Unfortunately, we did not read the instructions to the disposal and did not realize we had to replace the BioCharge - I didn't even know there was anything to replace. So last week we ended up on a Saturday having to call the septic pump people because of a clog in the pipe. The guy showed me all the grease and food gunk causing the problem and said a disposal cannot be used w a septic system So we decided we'd been sold a bill of goods and were not going to use the disposal anymore. Then, I thought I might as well look at the instructions for the heck of it and now have ended up here. After reading the positive reviews of other septic system homeowners, I am ordering 4 BioCharges, with plans to use them over the year, then have the septic yearly pump-out and see the results. 'Sure don't want to end up having to pay $500 to get unclogged again.I will post again after the year has passed with the outcome.A question: I was wondering if you who have had good experience follow the directions exactly on putting the food into the disposal - ie running cold water first, then slowly feeding food in, then running more cold water, etc?PS Because I had to rate this to submit my review, I gave it a 5* based on others reviews w similar situations to mine.",

    "I almost bought a lp to mp3 product to record on my computer until I seen this product on Amazon.com. This is old school and I love it! Don't bother with the computer method this is much simpler to use and it works great. Just hook it up to your receiver and start recording your lp's in no time. You have to use the analog input for lp's by pushing the input button on the front panel until analog shows up on the display and then push the auto/manual button until the manual input comes up on the dispay. First put in a blank cd-r audio disc in the recorder and wait for the blank disc shows up on the display. Then play your record and push record and wait for record pause to show up and you can set your recording level by using the level plus or minus buttons. Once you have the optimal recording level set you are ready to record. You also have to manually track each song by pushing the record button between each song so you can separate the tracks. It helps if you write down the song times on a sheet of paper so you can know when the songs will end. This way you can assure you will track each song properly without any problems. I love it and I am getting back to recording my albums like I used to when I had a cassete recorder. I highly recomend this Teac cd-r recorder and soon you will be making your own cd audio disks and loving it!",

It is a grease, but it is very soft. Will make even the toughest hair managable. For that alone I will continue to use it. I don't however looking at the ingredients think it will do much to stimulate hair growth. It may grow hair as a result of keeping it healthy, but will not encourage faster hair growth. I've noticed softer hair since using it, it has a pleasant smell that I can live with and is now a staple in my hair care regimine.",
    "I found that some of the tiny pieces I placed in the 150 would flip over before they reached the tape. I have to use really long tweezers to make sure it goes in properly. You can't just reach your fingers in easily to get it out, if it flips. I couldn't do it without the tweezers. It's great for the bigger pieces. I don't recommend this if you are doing a lot of pieces at once, because you have to rub a stylus around all the edges on the outside, and the inside. Otherwise, when you pull off the tape on top, you'll get sticky on the front of your pieces.",

    "To give you a good idea of what these tires will do, I need to tell you about the bike I got them for. It's a 1970's, French made, rigid frame, 5-speed double, youth, road bike with MTB bars, shifters, & brake levers that has 26x1-3/8\" rims with these Kenda Kross knobby tires - think \"old school\" MTB Lite. I use it for riding the local converted (as in \"rails to trails\") rail trail (RTB anyone?) two miles from my home. 27 inchers and 700Cs are just too skinny and dig into the soft stuff. 26\" MTB tires are too fat and have you huffin' & puffin' on the smooth stuff when you want to roll. 26 inch street tires on 590mm rims are about right but a little slippery in the muddy stuff. These Kenda Kross knobbies are just right. They pedal easily enough on the the street, and stick pretty well in the slippery stuff. They're not perfect so you do have to be careful or wind up taking a mud bath. They are a compromise like everything else bicycle. Some may say, Why not just get a mountain bike and be done with it?\" Well, I do have one; and sometimes it's just a little too much like driving a truck on our local rail trail.I took it out for a little ride today. There's still snow on the ground and some left on the streets, but these Kendas made a good showing for themselves. They worked out quite well and held in the small patches of noncompacted snow that were still left. Of course they do slip on hard packed snow like any other nonstudded bike tire.I like Kendas as I've used them in this size before on some of my other bikes. I was really amazed that anyone made a knobby in the size. Yes, they definitely do the trick and at half the price of Michelins. They even look cool too.",

    "This was my time switching to an organic deodorant; I was pleasantly surprised for about the 1st week ...but now I realize that clearly had more to do w/ nice weather than the deodorant. I'm nearing the end of the stick and have been disgusted by my own B.O. for a least a month. After I shower I apply once or twice a day; if I'm understand the sun the funk kicks in/if I'm reapplying, it kinda masks odor for about 30 minutes. I'm in LA, it gets hot; sometimes I bike, sometimes I'm just walkin to the corner store, either way I come home reeking. I am woman, my body doesn't perspire a lot, most of my sweat come out from my head. My pits end up smelling better when I don't use any deodorant at all (instead of Jason's)!",

    "The thing works spectacularly, I couldn't believe how little shavings there were on my work table because of the dust collector. I was shocked because the planer was attached to about 10' of 4\" hose on a 1 hp dust collector, so my expectations were pretty modest. Instead of having to sweep up half a trash can of shavings they were all in my dust collector! There were a few shavings that kicked back on the infeed side of the planer but that was all!My only complaint was the directions, or lack there of! There was nothing in my box other than the dust collector chute and two knobs, absolutely no directions. I went to the web-site and that was fruitless. I tried several options to install the dust chute and nothing seemed to make sense. Until I removed the plate over the cutter blades and realized that the dust chute replaces that cover and allows for dust collection. It took seconds to install once I made this discovery. The point is they could have had a simple one page direction and possibly the red letter warning lable about the cutter blades that is on the factory plate. But then I would have had to rate the tool as a 6 on the five point scale! If you own a dust collector and a 22-560 planer this accessory is a must!",
    "I got this magnetic base along with a separate dial indicator here on Amazon because I needed to tune up my table saw. I didn't want to spend a ton of money because I didn't see myself using this set of tools all that often. However I didn't pick the cheapest model either, because I wanted something decent. I normally don't write reviews, but my frustration with this product has pushed me to it... so here goesWhen I opened the package everything looked OK for the most part. I should mention that no instructions are included, which might be a problem for someone who hasn't used one of these before.As soon as I set the base up I noticed that the main post was loose and wobbled around quite a bit. No problem there, just tighten the nut at the base of the post, which i did, then noticed that the post was slightly bent. It may have been banged about during shipping a bit, but I wasn't too worried at this point because it didn't wobble any more even though it was a little crooked.Next I got my dial indicator attached to its mounting post and played around with a bit, rotating it this way and that. The swivels on the unit move well enough but they don't tighten down smoothly. Basically things slip around up until the point they are completely tightened. This can be a pain because it makes it hard to make fine adjustments with the base attached to the work surface and the indicator in place.Anyway at this point I got my saw taken apart, set up the base and indicator, got everything aligned and attempted to tighten down the knob on the main post. The weight of the indicator kept causing the collar to slip down the post, so I kept incrementally tightening it. Before it was tight enough to hold the weight of the indicator and extension arm assembly the collar fell apart. The bolt had completely stripped out. Now I have no idea what kind of steel they used for this particular bolt, but it died on the very first use, and I hadn't even tightened it enough to hold the dial in place. Needless to say I will be sending this back.Amazon is great for so many things, but sometimes you need to be able to hold a product in your hands before you purchase it, especially when it comes to tools. It really seems like tools are made to be disposable these days, and this particular item isn't even good for a single use. Since I wasn't able to use it I'll have to make the 2 hour drive to the closest place where I can get another magnetic base so I can finish my project. At least this way I can check the quality before buying it.",
    "Ok, this stuff is a bit like putting grease in your hair, but you use no more than a rice-sized amount and it will add shine and make your hair feel more healthy (and it may actually be!). I find the more I use it, the better my hair seems. It does have a slight odor similar to coffee beans, but I like that smell so it doesn't bother me. If your hair is dry or over-processed this stuff is for you - but if your hair is just very fine and limp, I don't think this product would be for you.",

    "Some may be confused by my rating for this product, but let me explain... After reading all the reviews for this product, I was so excited that I finally found something that would get my 3 year old son to stop sucking his finger. As suggested, we started with a small application on just the thumb area. I didn't want to experience any extreme adverse reactions (i.e vomiting). He stated that it wasn't \"tasty\" and pretty much kept it out of his mouth the entire time for that day. Later that evening when it was time for bed, he went to sleep with his thumb in his mouth as usual. The next day, we applied more but this time on a larger surface area of his thumb. He proceeded to wash it off but we kept him from doing so. Apparently, my son's taste buds wasn't too altered from this product because he sucked his thumb anyway inspite of a heavier application.Here is the reason for my 5-star rating: the taste is horrific! It is the worst, most bitter thing I have ever tasted. It's almost like a combination of crushed aspirin and bitter leaves or herbs. Additionally it leaves a horrible lingering taste on your tongue and lips that goes away on its time no matter how much you try and flush it with water. As one of the reviewers stated, it contaminates everything you plan to eat if you by chance use that finger to touch food. It doesn't take much at all...one slight touch and your food is ruined. Not to be gross, I even tested out the product by tasting my son's finger to see what he was experiencing (and yes, even his saliva)and it was AWFUL! I couldn't believe that it didn't phase him. I guess his thumb means that much to him. I believe this product would work if my son way younger - maybe. He's that individual who is not phased by the bitterness. I was hoping to have a different outcome to post. But I have to speak up for this product; I believe it could work if your child has a very sensitive palette. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case for my child, but I am hopeful that something will work...even if it's just time itself.",
    "Well, I don't know what I did differently, but I bought this one and the larger version (with the soap are in the middle) and the larger one started to \"lean\"... though it didn't fall off the wall. This one has worked perfectly so far, but I'm betting if I put even a little more weight in it, it might start doing what the other one did.very convenient though, and there's really nothing else like it",
    "This is exactly what I was looking for -- an inexpensive, easy-to-carry mat that gives me some padding while doing sit ups or other excercises on the floor. I'm very pleased with it. The one negative is that it doesn't lay completely flat when I roll it out, but I use a couple of hand weights to hold down the curly end. It rolls up very small to store in the hall closet. It seems to be sturdily made to last through a lot of sit ups.",

    "Elmer's Washable School Glue Sticks are a good adhesive choice for parents of young children. This product comes from a trusted name in glue and it's a product that can be counted on to perform its intended function with minimal messiness.Like the Elmer's liquid School Glue of old, Elmer's Washable School Glue Sticks also wash out using soap and water. The glue will wash out no matter how long it has been in the clothing. Whether it is still wet or completely dry, this glue can be removed from a child's clothing by washing them in the usual manner, according to the manufacturer's recommendation. There are no worries that your child's favorite shirt or blouse will be ruined when Elmer's Washable School Glue Sticks are in use. One run through the washing machine and the glue is gone.One variation of these glue sticks is the purple color. The product is the same as the regular (white) variety, but the color of the stick is purple. When spread on paper it still looks purple and many little kids will enjoy the color. But once it is dry, it changes back to clear so there is no need to worry that it will leave a colored mark. Some kids won't have any preference but others will strongly prefer the purple color to the plain white variety.Are there any cons with this product? I can think of only two: 1. A single tube doesn't last very long and 2. The product isn't designed for heavy duty use. If a person has a large amount of items to glue, the tube will be used up quickly making it less economical than other types of glue. Also, this is not heavy duty glue. Other Elmer's products can be used to glue all sorts of different materials but the glue in Elmer's Washable School Glue Sticks is not designed for this. Light materials like paper and cardboard are the only things on which this glue can be safely used. If you attempt to use it as an adhesive for something heavier, the glue will likely fail and the object will fall back apart.Overall, Elmer's Washable School Glue Sticks are a very good product for young kids. They are not as messy as liquid school glue and the ease of use makes youngsters less likely to accidentally get glue on their clothing. But if they do, there is no worry- the glue washes out easily. The glue is nearly 100 percent safe for kids and it makes a good choice of glue for little ones who want to exercise their creativity in a safe, controlled environment.",

You can place your eyelets anywhere.2. Even though it takes about 5 pushes to completely set an eyelet it is easy to do so, and I am 8 months pregnant.3.

    "These tires looked so cool online, and what an idea to have reflective qualities. So I ordered two. The reflective surface is nothing more than a powdery substance that was flaking off, as I removed them from the shipping box. It easily scratched off with little effort using my fingernail! None of it would have even lasted tire mounting, or it's first wash! I examined the quality of rubber and it looked like poor-quality (like tires from India, or other third-world origins). I folded the them up, and placed them back in the original container to ship back. After mailing both back to Overstock, the idiots there only credited by back for one tire (perhaps they couldn't count to two?). Amazing. Do not place these crappy tires on your bike. Purchase two of the very fine tires available for the same money, made my several good manufacturers, like Schwinn, Kenda, Michelin, etc...This is why here is never a lack of work for consumer attorneys, who can litigate so many things out there, designed and produced by boneheads, who don't know the difference.

    "Updated--I completely changed my mind, this is the best leave-in conditioner I've ever used. I'm not sure why, but I gave this product another try and it worked wonders. I think maybe I just got a bad or expired bottle last time. It conditions my hair like no other and it doesn't flake or leave residue like other leave-ins.Old Review--I have curly/wavy/frizzy hair and I was looking for a conditioner that would work well with keeping my hair healthy. I used this product for about two months and I wasn't impressed. The scent didn't smell so good, but I didn't really care so much because the scent didn't last long after blow-drying and straightening.It did a good job of moisturizing my hair, however my main complaint about the product overall is that it would make my hair too oily and irritate my scalp the 2nd day. (I wash my hair every other day.) I've never had this problem with any other conditioners I used in the past, so I didn't really know how to deal with it. I tried using less of the conditioner and just concentrating on my ends, but this didn't seem to help at all. I finally gave up and stopped using the product altogether. One positive thing about the conditioner is that it didn't make my hair hard at all like most other conditioners do to curly hair.",
    "Before I start, I have to tell you that I didn't try to use this endpin rest with a cello or an upright bass. I have a custom instrument, a modified guitarr&oacute;n with a home made endpin, the bottom end of which is an ordinary 1-inch, rubber cane tip--so this might not apply to your instrument.Anyway, this thing worked pretty well on carpet where you don't need it. The lip isn't very high, though, so my cane tip did want to come out of it. Where you DO need it--on a hardwood or synthetic floor--this thing was useless. It slid around worse than my cane tip by itself. If you get down on your knees each time you want to use it with a can of Pledge and a dust rag and clean all the dust off the floor first, then do that to the bottom of this endpin rest, it'd probably work fine--but who wants that? Or you could spill some cola on the floor first and let it get tacky--that would help this endpin rest considerably, I'll bet. Or just use it on carpeting.Anyway, I made the perfect endpin rest myself. It consists of a metal cappuccino cup and four-foot web strap and buckle. One end of the strap goes around the cup handle and the other goes around the rung or leg of whatever chair or stool I'm sitting on. Totally solid and secure. Works absolutely perfectly.",

    "ok, so it's not a great meal, but you probably guessed that.I bought several varieties of these pouches from AlpineAire because we have one person in our family who requires a special diet, and I want to be prepared for emergencies. AlpineAire makes several GF pouches which fit our needs, and I can find them easily at a local sporting goods store. In addition to this beef pouch I got the roast beef hash and the brown rice. None of them were horrible, just not great. They would definitely serve in an emergency situation and are much better than the camping freeze dried foods we had as kids. They do seem a bit heavy handed with the spices, which is a problem when you're feeding kids, but otherwise are acceptable.What you need to know about them:They do require clean, hot, water to rehydrate.The steeping time on the packages was always a little off- the hash never did quite rehydrate all the way down.Because you pour the hot water into the pouch- it becomes HOT!!!! and they don't stand up on their own. At least not the ones I tried. I had to prop them against something while they steeped, and one time the rice fell over and spilled some of the water. So be careful- not a job for the kids to do.There was a lot of water left in the bottom of the pouches. It made the last several bites very soupy and unappealing. I ended up draining as I ate, but it seemed that the left over water and the rehydrating problem are probably related. Maybe if you stir the contents of the pouch halfway through it would be better?All in all, they serve very well as back up food as long as you will have a source of clean water and a way to heat it. If you think your situation may be more dire than that- look elsewhere.There is a large variety of entree, side dishes and even desserts available. You can find them at stores like REI, or order direct from their website http://www.aa-foods.com/for other choices. The 2,or 4 serving sized pouches are nice and the website has other, canned items, that are shelf stable for a longer period of time.Bottom line: I will be ordering more for \"just in case\", along with water purification tablets and our camping stove. Someone said, wisely I think, that this stuff is like food insurance. And like other types of insurance, you're really hoping you never have to use it.",

Our whole family has injoyed the amazing transformation of the rocks as we complete each step. My 10 year old loves to collect rocks and wanted this toy more than anything, and my 5 year old has fallen in love with the beautiful gems. They come out smooth and shiny like the ones you see for sale... We have transformed a little over a pound of rocks since we started and the Tumbler is still working like new. As a Mother I am impressed with how much interest my children have taken in erosion. My 10 year old has been reading books on the forces of nature in its natural state and the changeing of lanscapes, and as we clean the rocks and prepare for the next step in the Tumbleing process He has been eager to tell my 5 year old about the entire process and how it takes millions of years for a rock to get like this naturally and we are doing it in less then one month. I am considering getting another one for my younger child to have to polish her own collection of rocks. If you are considering getting this toy I am sure your family will be as satisfied as mine is.",

    "I heard about Wildroot Cream Oil on a vintage radio program. It was popular in the 50s (I'll bet my dad used it!) and advertised for the whole family. Something about the barbershop quartet singing, \"Try Wildroot Cream Oil --- CHAR-lie!\" over and over again apparently got into my brain, because when I cut my hair very short recently I was really curious to try it. Very glad to see Amazon had it, and very pleased with the soft styling that just a tiny amount will achieve. No more stiff mousse or gel for me. The bottle arrived quickly and will last me a long time.",

It would have been so cool to have, it has a TV and DVD player to watch movies, but even the movies would freeze up once in a while. It made me sad to have to take it back and I hope we can find another one like it. I thought mine was defective and tried to exchange it but they ran out of new ones. Now I see a lot of people must have the same problem.",

Even after several years of frequent use the durable Fiskars have maintained their sharpness and good performance.She let me make a few cuts with her favorite pair of scissors, and I must say they are very comfortable and quite remarkable in function.",
    "I actually purchased this because I needed a soft towel to dry my 12 pound dog with after bathing him. This microfiber towel absorbs water very well. It i soft and thin and when I use it to dry my dog it absorbs water from his wet hair much faster than a regular towel. The towel also dries out well and doesnt have a weird smell that regular towels get after getting wet and drying. As far as using this towel as a hair towel and not for a dog, I think it would work well for the majority of hair lengths and thicknesses. It is smaller than a regular towel so Im not sure how well you could do the wrap, twist, and throw on top of your head towel thing with your hair, but if you need a towel to help assist in drying out your hair quickly, this will do a good job.",

    "A good leatherman is more usefull than you think. Ask anyone who carries them regularly, you'll be surprized how often it comes in handy (and I'm not just talking about the knife).The Leatherman Wave has everything I'm looking for at a reasonable price. If you're looking for a better steel in your leatherman look at the Leatherman Blast, it is near identical to the Wave but more expensive because it uses a better steel. Anyway, back to the Wave.Pros:All the tools lock open, including the blades.Blades are on the outside of the tool, making them as easy to get to as your basic pocket knife.The wood saw blasts through wood.Bit Driver with exchangabe bits is genious and works very wellVery small jewelers screwdriversScissors bigger (though not by much) than swiss army knivesCons:The outside of the handles aren't smoothed (sharp squared off corners), which cause a little discomfort when using the bladesScrewdriver bits will bend if really torqued on.Leather/Nylon sheath is bulkyI recommend the all nylon sheath (sold separate), its a little lighter and more importantly its not as bulky. In fact the nylon sheath (for the wave and blast) is the most compact leatherman sheath I've ever seen. It holds one of the additional bit driver sheets (again, sold separate) and has two elastic loops on the sides for pens or small flashlights. I wear my wave every day, I preffer wearing it horizontal above my back right pocket, though it does kinda get in the way of getting to my wallet.",

    "This has been one of my favorite soap brands for a long time but I have never used any shower creams from Roger & Gallet in the past. This was truly worth the splurge since the rich milk is soft and soothing on the skin as very little is needed, it has lasted me twice as long as the matching body lotion and it makes my morning and night bathroom routine a very pleasant experience.This lathers up nicely, not necessarily foaming bubbles but cleansing the skin with softness and care and a scent to rave about. The scent of vanilla sap is more creamy and almost like a sweet version of sandalwood than the usual vanilla bean fragrances everyone is used to. I adore using this since it feels so luxurious and lasts for a long time, making my bathroom cabinet look pretty and my skin silky soft. I highly recommend using it with the Roger & Gallet Vanilla Sap Restructuring Body Lotion for a complete experience.- Kasia S.",
    "I routinely do squats with an olympic bar @ 305lbs and this pad makes it more comfortable. Good posture, form, and technique do not help the fact that you have hundreds of pounds focused on such a small area of the shoulders. I tend to have issues with the bar crushing the skin between the bar and shoulder muscles, as well as the area of C7-T1(since I am not fat the processes of these bones are very close to the surface). This pad has helped that load to be dispursed over a greater surface area thus reducing the discomfort and redness associated with missing skin layers. It fits my bar just barely. It is a tight fit. The velcro and other materials seem to be glued on, and so I have to wonder how long this pad will last. It is inexpensive though.",
    "I did a lot of research before purchasing this sewing machine, both in local stores and online. I read many of the reviews on this machine before making the purchase. I have not yet had a chance to look at or try all the attachments, accessories, and stitches. There's so much!! The machine is very light weight, but seems very sturdy. It's very quiet and runs smoothly. Threading the top of the machine is very simple and I like that the bobbins are the same size as those I had from the Kenmore machine I'm replacing. The additional detachable table and hard cover are great bonuses. I was worried about having this machine shipped to Hawaii (cost and condition), however, to my great delight, shipping was FREE and the machine arrived in 4 days, in perfect condition!! I'm very happy with this machine and the price, and the convenience of home delivery cannot be beat! Thank you!",

    "I have been looking for the Ray-Ban aviators for a long time. I saw these at Amazon and i was so stunned when they were only 70 dollars! At other stores they're roughly around $100-140 which is quite expensive. I went to Sunglasses Hut to try them on to see if they would fit before i bought them. The sunglasses hut i went to didn't have the 52mm so i tried on the 55mm which was way too big so i thought that the 52mm would be a good size. When i ordered my sunglasses they took about a week and 1 day to get here. I expected quicker shipping but it was alright considering i didn't have to pay shipping. I opened the box and saw them i thought they were way too small! but i tried it on and it was a bit small. i didn't want to go through all the shipping to get it back so i just decided to keep them. They're actually really nice though. my 8 year old sister fits them better than I do.They're Made In Italy, which is a BIG plus. The colors are very nice! the metal frame is really shiny gold and the lens has a bit of a reflection which i like. I have a small-medium face, somewhere in between that, so if you have a large face or a slightly bigger medium face i do not recommend this product for you because it may be way too small! these are NOT children sunglasses, they're just for those with a smaller face. so buyers be warned. Overall i think i spent a very reasonable amount of money on these sunglasses and i am very satisfied.",

    "I own two of the large sampras ball hoppers and one of these small ones......love them. First of all, I honestly think both the large model and the smaller sampras/unique plastic ball hoppers do NOT hold what is stated. Probably get 33 balls in the smaller one and 70-75 in the larger one (that's fine with me - who honestly is counting and perfectly getting every little ball in there). The balls will jam up a little bit if you try to cram every little ball in there. The company does need to re-design the interior of the basket. It's not smooth, so the edges can grab a few balls as you fill up the basket, and can scrape your hand a little bit as you reach in and out.I love using the smaller 36 ball hopper because I can bring this one with me at all times. If I'm playing a friend, we have plenty of balls to hit with and do a few drills. Going thru more (say 60 or more balls) gets very tiring and probably a little boring for the one who is doing all of the \"feeding\" during the drills. 30-36 balls seems like a good number to get thru a drill quickly, pick up the balls, switch and get going again. The main reason I really like the smaller size is to always have in the trunk and use for serving practice. Again, getting thru 30-36 balls seems like a good number to practice serving into one box, before taking a break, picking up, grabbing some water, relax for a few minutes and then switch to serve over into the other box.I haven't had any problems with the plastic breaking or splitting. All of mine are not abused, but they have been in and out of trunks alot and fallen over plenty of times on the courts. I only used my larger ball hoppers for dumping 75-150 balls into my ball machine. Otherwise, the smaller model is my bread-butter and go to basket for everyday use. The only other model out there that I would personally recommend is the masterpro 72 or 50 (or larger).....if you still need a basket that picks up and flips over to stand up. Those are very well put together too, but more on the traditional powder-coated steel construction model.",

Even worse, I have rode it a couple of times already, and the Front Derailleur is already damaged. I need to have this bike tuned up at the local bike shop which will set me back an additional $50.00. While I do expect for Schwinn to make good on the warranty, and send me a replacement part, it is a hassle to have to register, and wait for it. Unfortunately, I may need to come out of pocket even more if I want the part replaced sooner. Overall, this bike is okay, but I will recommend to do serious research before deciding on this one.",

    "have owned this for a couple months, now. since i've had this a couple things have happened. first, i tried this with my old turntable, new audio-technica PL120 and compared it to my stock cartridge (AT-something). the stock cart was nice, no issues. this grado was lower output and slightly lower bass. HOWEVER, clarity was great. lots of back and forth, final conclusion was that this grado does sound much better. bass was just tighter and clarity is a very good thing as well as less noticeable scratchy sounds. only drawback is that with the setup i had (turntable with internal preamp to mixer to amplifier), i was getting a little hum at high volumes. not good.NOW, i have a new (to me) turntable: a used Technics SL1200 mk2 with a ground wire (unlike my AT) and a dj mixer with phono inputs and ground lug. low and behold, two turntables side by side, the experience has reversed: my new technics (although not brand new) can get turned up to the max with ZERO HUM with grado cart. absolutely ZERO. on the other hand, the AT with the AT cartridge (which performed as i initially thought it should) at close to max presents a faint hum (MUCH less than the grado in old AT table setup): super faint, but i do know it's there by comparison the the technics.bottom line: the GRADO is a better cart, OVERALL. but, the AT is louder and boomier in the bass. the grado needs to have the gain turned up a little higher and maybe turn down the treble. but, here's the kicker: the grado is $60 and the AT is $100. so, if you have a turntable with a ground wire and a phono preamp (or my dj mixer) this grado should be an obvious pick. if your rig doesn't have a ground, look at something else. maybe AT or Shure.",

    "I recommend this product. I'm not a workout freak. I just wanted something to strengthen my neck because I was having neck pains from too much computer work. So I got this. I have never used similar products, but this one seems very good. It's 8 pounds so I was glad it was heavier than all the others I researched. It's well-made and stays on your head. I can feel it working very fast when I lean back a little bit, or even roll my head around very slowly like a stretch. It provides a very good workout in a passive way. You don't have to put all this effort into lifting something. You just lean back or at an angle, whichever way you wish to strengthen, and you will feel your muscles really work. It felt great to me because I'm used to sitting long hours at a desk and only utilizing the muscles on the back of my neck. This gives me an excellent and relatively effortless way to get an intense workout on the muscles I never use, the ones on the front side of my neck. This has helped my neck pains tremendously, and even alleviated stress as a result, since everyone knows that so much tension is carried in our neck and shoulder area. I do recommend this. The picture doesn't make it look like anything special, but this is a quality, heavy-duty product so don't hesitate to buy.",

We tried hanging VERY light things(using mulitple hooks, mind you)without any success for more than a day. After multiple attemps, I said forget it because I knew that something I was attempting to hang was going to end up falling and getting broken with these useless hooks. Furthermore, when they fell off, they took the new paint with it! Not only did they not work, but they were NOT damage free. I ended up using small hanging nails in the end, which was what I was trying to avoid in the first place by buying these. These were a complete waste of time and money, and also damaged my freshly painted walls! NOT HAPPY!",

    "This sleep mask is light weight, fits snugly and is comfortable to wear. I don't know how long it will last. You might want to order two at a time, especially if you plan to keep them clean by washing. The sleep mask keeps the forehand warm and may provoke sweating.",
    "This machine is fantastic. It has many features and gets the job done. A lot of value for very little money.",
    "This is an awesome product. It produces a really clean sound, giving you that greaty 'plucky' quality. Turning up the sustain between 12:00 and 3:00 is the sweet spot for this pedal. The sustain is so natural. Finally, I like combining it with an overdrive pedal. Set your gain to low or medium (I prefer the Zen pedal, but also use the Ibanez T9 mod plus), and the Keeley compressor transforms that into a truly warm quality that is great for blues/rock, maintaining a nice crisp edge. The Keeley compressor is a bit more expensive than other compressors, but from what I've heard and going by the experiences of my friends, it is well worth the difference.",

    "I loved these gloves, they fit my XXL hands just fine and provided good flexiblity and protection. I recently used up my last pair and ordered a bunch more only to find out they have been extensively redesigned.If you liked the Orginals these are no longer them. For one thing they fit much tighter and I would be surprised if they actually sized much more than a XL even though they are selling them as XXL. The long and short of it is that I returned them due to sizing issues. Based on the XXL sixing I would say to order a size up if you want a good fit.Other changes include changed closure and fabric around the thumb and index finger. I do not know if these changes are good or bad as I have not used them but feel the changes to the closure which is now much thicker plastic are bad.Can someone recommend a good glove in XXL to replace this brand.",

    "As a bass guitarist, this pedal is slightly limited on all it's features. The \"oct 1\" or one octave below function is pretty good, a little hard to catch on the lower strings of a 4-string bass, but still audible. However, the 2 octave function isn't of much use at lower notes. Also, the drive channel isn't anything spectacular. I'd still use an ODB-3 or Big Muff to get any distortion.",
    "This unit puts out a lot of light. It is definitely a pinpoint spot. It does not wash nearly as much as my regular spot bulbs. However, the light has a definite blue tint to it. I'm not sure how that may affect the color on the video of my performances, but will keep an eye on it.",
    "I love these stands. I have several of them and really should have more because my band mates keep claiming them. Low profile so they don't take up a much room.

I read through the manual pretty well (something I don't often do) and still I just couldn't get the hang of it.The preset patterns are nice, but I'm doing rock music and most of them seemed too busy. The patterns ARE editable if you can figure it out. I couldn't.Instead I found a VERY easy to edit app for the iPad that cost just $7. So I ended up returning this.I'm not saying this is a bad piece of equipment. The sounds are very nice and the touchpads are very usable if you've got an understanding of drumming. Unfortunately for me, but I just couldn't get the interface and editing steps through my thick skull",

    "I like this amp. It is quiet at full volume. However, the new lower priced amps are configured differently than the older ones or the high end models. I don't know the proper terminolgy for this but they just don't have the \"power floor\" the older amps do. In other words, this sounds more equivocal to a 50 watt amp as oppossed to a 100 watt amp running through 8 ohm speakers in a stereo mode. If you run monitors in a series you drop your ohm load (to 4 ohms with two speakers), the volume is louder but the amp also clips more easily. I use this for my monitor and is more than adequate for small venues. The case is well put together and solid. Again, it is clean and quiet and I've had no issues with it so far.",

The needle no longer moves and the machine will barely turn on.

Not sure what happened, i did notice the seller (Online Tactical Store LLC) has several people saying they are selling counterfiets and fakes on other products!! They also shipped this poc in a freaking zip lock bag and claimed it was new!!!!!!!!!!! Serpa is great quality usually for the price. I had to order another holster to replace this poc one.",

I had tried another brand and they bent easily when you tried to stick them into styrofoam and wasted a lot of them. I made a curly ribbon wreath for Independence Day and these pins worked out perfectly. Not one bent or failed to go into the styrofoam. The point is sharp for easy insertion and the metal is not soft to avoid bent pins.I am very happy with Singer's pins and will more than likely buy more for future projects.",
    "I have an autoimmune disorder that makes the skin on my palms very , dry, and they peel and sometimes bleed. I've used L'Occitane Organic Shea, mixed with Aquafor, after perscription ointments and creams didn't help. I've had good success with my existing routine. But the L'Occitane is $39 a can, which is quite pricey, for me. So, when I found this, I was excited to use it. Especially after reading the description. The price is fantastic which is why it got 1 star from me.As for my issues: 1) It stained my gloves, and I got a tiny piece on my nightgown which is stained too. 2) The smell is hideous. It reminds me of terrible baby vomit. 3) After going through all of this, it didn't moisturize my skin nearly as well as the L'Occitane Organic Shea Butter, mixed with Aquafor. I did mix this product with my Aquafor as well.I should say too ,this product is very hard. So you'll need a makeup or other little spatula to use it.",

These make great presents for all occasions, birthdays, Christmas, Father's Day, anniversaries. Make your special day all the more special with a brass ball, or two!",

I am a widower and have only used it one time but it worked great. I loaded the Bobbin and it was very easy to do. The only problem I had was threading the needle due to my poor eyesight. I couldn't believe all the features on it. As a male I will not use the vast majority of them but they are there should I ever want to. I think it is a great Sewing Machine for a Beginner like meself. Operators's Manual is printed in easy-to-understand English with pictures showing you how to do everything. I recommend it very highly.",

    "Update An Easy Fix and reccomendations to Greatly improve the sound:A Bass problem Solved.Many basses Particularly the Epiphone Eb-0 and Gibson EB basses.. But other basses also can have this problem especially short scaled ones. The problem is when the cotton or metal windings are resting over the bridge saddle. I have searched extensively over the internet and found no easy solution that would not require machine tooling and hard to find parts. What you need is a spacer that will go down the strings...and will stop at the Ball / Ring end. I came up with a very easy fix that anyone can do.. All you need are Steel 8-32 Nut's. The Type a screw goes into. The Size is based in USA.. So foreign sized may be different.. If so just bring you \"E\" string to you hardware store and try out different sizes until you land one that fits as I initially did. I found I only needed one or 2 nut's and that moved back the windings so only the string part rested on the Saddle. The mount of nut's needed may vary depending on the type of strings so just in case buy 5 nut per string and your covered. They cost less than 10 cents each. As a result intonation was perfect and the action and tonal qualities sounded correct and made a huge difference in the overall sound as a big Improvement.If using an Epiphone EB0 bass I spoke with Epiphone to find out the Gauge strings the Bass was designed and setup for: They told me to use: E: .105 A: .080 D: .065 G: .045 .If buying a new Epiphone please trust me one this.. Change the strings!!! I could not find and exact match but the closest I found in gauge were all the same except for the A string being .085 in a set of Ernie Ball Hybrid slinky roundwounds - which worked perfectly.. The intonation did not go off on the A string.Hope this Helps as an easy fix that will make your bass sound vastly improved. Remember the cotton or cloth or metal winding should never rest or touch the saddle.. And should always be well behind it. This fix is cheap and an easy fix!!Hope this helps!----------------------------------------------------------------------------This is my older review before I used the nut Spacer and changed strings:The sound and performance is greatly improved now. Still some Buzzing but much better overall than before....I have been playing bass for more than 30 years and used to own an Original Gibson EB0 made in the 60's which this bass copies. Gibson still also sells and makes a replica of this bass but you can expect to pay well over $1,000.00. Firstly the sidewinder pickup is not designed nor sounds nearly as good as the original.The Bass Buzzes like crazy - I have no intension of filing down frets in an attempt to maybe change that. The Epihone Basses as this model are notorious for the felt or string windings resting on the saddle where they should never be but the felt completely goes over the saddle of the bridge on the E string.. this is a known flaw... and you will need spacers to correct that. The felt or string winding should always be behind the saddle. The sound barley provides a distinguishable sounding note unless you amp or use effects that treble up the sound.. and even then it sounds lousy.. Noisy electronics' that are not properly shielded with poor electronics. I own another short scale Bass a Korean made Dan Electro that has nice low action with no buzzing and clear tones, and the ability to get a nice boomy sound or a very trebly at your choosing. You can distinguish on a boomy muddy setting on the Dan E. the note of the fret.. the EB0 you could be one fret high or low and the tone is hardly noticeable.. great if you make mistakes as no-one will be able to hear them! The wood and finish feels like a quality bass.. but the rest of the bass is junk. If you want that Animals classic bass sound and tone.. I would suggest looking into Eastwood's classic 4 semi hollow body, or the new Magnum bass which has a massive pickup right at the neck just like the EB basses, but more powerful and great sounding. The Eastwood Magnum bass just came out it is costly at $750. but will give you those low deep tone sounds. The Classic 4 sounds quite good in that regard too and gives a nice classic bass sound without sacrificing quality.. and cost $450. You can always get a fender Jazz but they have less boom and are not short scaled. The Classic 4 Eastwood is short scale tho the Magnum (copy of 70's Ovation Magnum Bass) is full scale. There are videos demo'ing these on youtube... I suggest spend a little more and get better quality. If you cant afford much more then I would suggest get a Fender Squire version of the Jazz Bass.. and use an amp or Bass effect device to get the tones you like.",
    "Solid design and engineering. I like the strong alloy screws included - stronger than stainless steel and much stronger than common wood screws.One major complaint; the system will not work on my Les Paul without modification. The supplied screws are #6 size, while my Gibson uses #8 on both ends. I modded #8's to fit, but Schaller should offer a version for Pauls.",
    "Great toy that doesn't require a lot of assembly or batteries. Get two of these and just the pure fun of sitting across the room from each other is hilarious to watch your opponents' hair fly.

I was afraid that the plastic inside would tear quickly, but it is incredibly strong. My son has had his for 2 years, and I just got one for my niece.",

    "This works great for one layer of fabric - but does not work that well with 2 or more. The pair I purchased seem to be less sharp back towards the handle which quite frankly could just be a defect in my pair. The handles are easy to use - the spring action obviously makes it less fatiguing on your hands. I just wish I could find a pair of pinking scissors that worked on more than one layer, since I use them to cut the ends of new fabric before I wash it; it reduces the fraying that often happens in the wash/dryer.",

    "I needed some stuff sewn by machine and having it done by someone else would be too expensive. I asked my wife and she told me that she didn't have the skill level required. So, I bought this machine, followed the directions in the printed manual and now I'm sewing all kinds of fabric together. (Some of it is even usable when I'm done.) For a first machine this is wonderful. It won't do thick multiple layers (I've done 4 layers of fleece, but it didn't like it.) and I wouldn't try leather unless it was really thin, but it will do the basics and then some.Cautions: Use good thread or you will have problems with your thread breaking or tangling on the bottom. Don't sew too fast for the fabric you are working on or your thread will break. (Fleece requires a medium speed at the most.) Don't try to start too close the the edge of your fabric or the feet won't feed. (At least with fleece.)Tip: When sewing fleece use masking tape to stabilize the fabric and keep it from stretching and bunching. Just don't sew through the tape; sew next to it. After testing several stitches I've been using the triple stitch (02) at the lowest settings for fleece with good results. (Yes, I've been sewing a lot of fleece. It's one of the major reasons I bought the machine.)",

It is light and easy for a child to apply - not sticky and it soaks in very quickly. Pleasant light smell and we would not be without it. She uses it on the insides of her elbows, back of knees, chest and face and anywhere where the skin is dry and sore. NO other cream has worked for us and we have tried everything. The thing to do is attack the excema vigorously for a week with specific PRESCRIBED steroidal cream... then use this MORNING and NIGHT and after bath or swimming, to keep the excema at bay. When we stop using it, the excema comes back... so we keep on using it, until hopefully she might grow out of the excema.",

They say anything from discontinue use after 7 days because it causes skin irritation to avoid completely, because it causes cancer. Maybe it does and maybe it does not.

As a designer of jewelry I have to make sure that the items I use are real and not marred in any way. This particular fan always makes a lovely necklace,especially when I add some rose quartz beads. The delivery time is amazing as I never have had to wait for long before my order gets here. I highly recommend this seller and the items for sale,",
    "Strong, sharp and nice to handle. Too bad the Oxo people didn't take a cue from gardening shears & make these so that you can open and lock them with one hand. Having to use two hands to open and close these scissors is a real annoyance.",
    "A bit time consuming for kids to use. I bought them for my little handicapped kiddos and they really were quite safe with them and it really builds up hand muscles but don't use them for large crafts as it will be too taxing for their hands. I took them with me went I switched to kindergarten and they also worked great for the little ones who are not quite ready for regular scissors. I also used them during center time so that all the kids could be independent with a cutting activity no matter what their level of scissor skills.",
    "My daughter received this bead set for her 3rd birthday. The hand painted beads are bright and attractive, and she was eager to start beading. However, the rough texture of the wood on the inside of the beads makes it a frustrating experience- she isn't able to bead without assistance. We ended up exchanging the beads for a set with a smoother interior surface. My sister also purchased these beads for her nearly three year old, and she had the same experience; her daughter was unable to string the beads- the laces snag on the rough interior surface, making it difficult to bead.",

    "Unfortunately, this product did nothing to make it easier to brush my daughter's hair. It was supposed to make it softer, but it actually made it harder to brush. I really wanted this to work because as my daughter's hair grows, it gets more difficult to brush. Wish the result would have been different. :(",
    "It works good so far and i have not had any problems with it. my hair does not stay straight so i have to press my hair a lot so it worth it.",
    "Ok so let me first give you all a brief description of my hair.I have very thick long wavy hair (naturally), but I do occationally straighten it with a flat iron. When I leave it natural (wavy), I let it air dry then put a little gel in it to keep it from frizzing up (which it soooo will if I dont put anything in it). It tends to look very dry even though I have nice waves. When I straighten it with a flat iron my ends look fried, but for the most part the rest of my hair will have an ok shine to it (nothing too amazing). After a couple of years of coloring my hair (base color + full highlights), it's ruined the texture I used to have. I can't blow dry it to save my life cause I have entirely too much hair, and I have yet to master the curling iron to create lose curls. Until NOW...Ok soo, it says to apply a dimes worth. Since i have so much hair I made a part down the middle and applied about a nickles worth to each side (from root to tip). I decided to see if it would help me defeat the blow dryer and curling iron.Mission #1: the blow dryer- Still suck at it lol. Mission #2: the curling iron- and it came out gorgeous!!!I can't even begin to explain how many times I've tried to do my hair with a curling iron, and it looked horrible every single time. This Hot Sauce gave sooo much life to my hair. It felt silky, soft, smooth, and absolutely no fried looking ends. I DIDN'T use hair spray or any other hair products (only Hot Sauce). Each curl came out perfectly and held in place. Im convinced its because of this product. All I can say is...does it only come in ONE SIZE! Ugh the downfall is. I have so much hair, and the bottle is tiny. This stuff is amazing and everyone needs to try it. I've tried so many hair products. This is now my favorite of all time. Keep in mind that all hair is different. What works for me might not work for you, and what works for you might not work for me. But its so worth trying. This is the cheapest I've found it, and it came very quickly.BUY BUY BUY BUY BUYNOTE TO SELLER: You should start selling them in packs as well.",
    "I really love this pistol. It might be my favorite. My interest in airsoft is almost purely for collection and target shooting, not any kind of competition, and this gun really scratches my detail-craving itch.Pros:- Very durable. Mine still works perfectly after a bad drop. Some ABS plastic pistols feel cheap as soon as you pick them up, this one doesn't.- Maintenance friendly. The slide stop pin is removable, and allows you to disassemble the gun. If yours stops working, try taking it apart and putting it back together once or twice (I did this after dropping it, afraid it was completely broken).- Realistic. While the gun is mostly plastic (except the trigger), the mold appears to be dead on for a Colt M1911. Some airsoft pistols have inaccurate looking magazines, this is not one of them.- Functional parts. As a collector, one of my favorite things about this pistol is how many parts work on it. While the slide stop pin doesn't actually stop the slide, the grip safety and slide safety are completely operable, and accurate to a real M1911. The hammer also moves, which is always a nice touch.- Power. This pistol has a lot of punch, easily better than 300 FPS.Cons:- Hop up. .12g BBs are not accurate in my pistol because of the high hop up. Even .20g BBs seem to rise a bit when fired from my pistol. From other reviews, it sounds like this isn't consistent behavior for this model. The hop-up doesn't appear to be adjustable.Again, this is probably my favorite airsoft pistol thus far. If you're thinking about getting it, you should.Update: I like it so much, I decided to get a second in silver.Final note: If you want a second magazine for this pistol, Amazon has them:TSD Sports UA961 Airsoft Pistol 22 Round MagazineThat item is only 1 magazine, but it fits the UA961 (this pistol). The magazine in the far left of the picture is the one you will receive.",
    "I love my Light tracer! It produces nice bright light without being blinding to look at. The surface of the box does not get hot, so you can work with it for a long time.I use it to transfer my drawings onto fabric for quilting and embroidery, and it works beautifully.10\" by 12\" size does not limit me to that size artwork. It is easy to transfer larger drawing by doing them in pieces. I just shift both the drawing and the fabric, since it is so easy to see through fabric and drawing to re-align them once you move to the next section.The light box is light and stores away neatly. The cardboard case that it came in is sturdy and has a handle. The box is easy to store it away and take it out when you need it.",
    "I have used a heavier duty model for high caliber ammunition and was initially concerned that this might reveal some of the same shortcomings, but it worked flawlessly and does not incur the kind of damage to the dowel pins on misses that the heavier model does with .38, .357, .44, and 9mm rounds. Whether you are using a pistol or rifle, the convenience of the resetting paddle is worth the entire purchase price. The frame and anchor rods are robust enough and sufficient to keep it in place even on relatively soft ground during our trials. In areas such as an old quarry that are too rocky to drive in the stakes, you might want to mount it on a plywood base. if you aren't fond of replacing the target decals, you can do a quick touch-up on the paddles with a can of spray paint after each use in preparation for the next outing. Make your practice session more interesting by making a friendly game of mixing it up with the sequence in which to hit and reset the targets for both markmanship & memory. 1-2-3-4-reset;1-4-reset;2-3-reset;1-3-2-4-reset;individual reset one-by-one -- use your imagination. Fun for the whole family.",

    "I have not really tested the product yet, BECAUSE there is no power adapter included. It needs to be ordered separately. You need to order the Yamaha PA3C or PA3B Power Adapter (unless you already have one of course [haha]). Both of these are mentioned on the box as possible adapters. If you read the description on Amazon's site carefully you will find that it only mentions the PA3B, which is not available via amazon. However, the PA3C is possible to order, so get it as well in case you are considering this product. Just figured that all potential buyers should be aware of the issue. The lack of an adapter was not clearly emphasized (it is in the fine print)in the product description. Hmmm! I was not very happy at the moment I realized it.......",
    "First of all, this thing is huge.. be prepared. The top was screwed down so hard that it took 2 people to open it the 1st time. After the initial opening, it still was difficult to both open and close. The final problem finished it off for me. It leaked around the spout while pouring. This was a complete waste of money.",

    "My first encounter with this fragrance was in the lotion form, given to me by my grandmother. At first, I thought it was too much for me. However, years later I caught a whiff of it and decided to try it out. I went into Sephora and spritzed some on. Later that evening, I asked my boyfriend to tell me what he thought. Needless to say, rave reviews! A few little sprays lasted the whole day. Since purchasing and wearing it daily, I get compliments from anyone who is within smelling distance (usually in a hug, and both men and women!). It makes me feel classy and sophisticated, without being overly musky. Lasts a long time and I rarely need touch ups (though I usually have a small bottle in my purse). It depends on your own body chemistry, so I recommend trying it on your skin first. I think this is definitely a long term scent for me, one that makes me feel more mature (as opposed to the fruitier scents I wore in my late teens/early 20's) and worth every cent! I found it at a local Burlington Coat Factory for about the same price here, for 1.7oz. Glad I can still find it cheaper than in some of the other stores!",
    "This perforator does exactly what it was purchased for, but since it is so small, it feels kind of awkward in my hand. I bought this tool becuase I needed it to accurately make a straight perforated line. Since the blade is so small, I cannot have it rest against my guide ruler. I am able to get it to work, but it is not perfect. But, for the price, I cannot really complain. I have not yet located another hand help perforator tool.",

This storage cart is such a good product and its also very easy to assemble. I use this to store my make up and its very convinient for me since i have a somewhat large collection of cosmetics.The only downside is if you put a lot of heavy items in the drawers it will weigh it down which can cause the drawer to go off track but other than that its perfect! Also if u have a small room this will be perfect for you it takes almost no space! I would recomend this product to anyone who just needs something simple to store cafts or makeup or anything for that matter!

    "First off, the basics, which seem to be lacking in the product description: 51 sheets, 17 colors, including primary colors, fluorescents, and metallics.This paper is probably a good choice for kids or origami beginners. The paper is thick, glossy, and bright, making it easy to fold and fairly vivid for designs. It's hard to get delicate with small folds, though, because of the thickness, and the one-color sheets (which are white on the back) aren't particularly interesting for use in designs, once you've made a few.The enclosed booklet is pretty basic, and includes five designs: airplane, swan, fortune cookie (looks like classic \"fortune teller\"), wishing star, and inflatable cube. Again, good for absolute beginners, but it's not a set of paper that I'd buy more than once.",

It came in a nice canvas pouch with very good instructions and has a nice long cord. It also came with 2 spare pole pieces and a hex wrench. It fits perfectly in the soundhole and is relatively easy to install & remove. The cord does not interfere at all when playing. I plug directly into a Fender Champ tube amp with no noticeable noise. Also sounds great using an effects pedal. Overall, it's very well made, looks really nice and sounds great. I would highly recommend this pickup.",

    "I'm not an artist, I just love to colour. I have a lot of different kinds of coloring media and I use Dover, Pomegranate, and Mindware coloring books. I'm not so much concerned with the blending capabilities of these markers as I am with their abilty to lay down smoothly on the paper without leaving streaks and ink pools. For me, these markers have not performed as well as the Sharpie Brush Tip markers when it came to just coloring. I have not used them for artistic projects because as I mentioned before, I'm not an artist, so I can't judge them in that respect, but I do appreciate a good marker. The ink flow is very good, almost too good, sometimes too much ink flows out and you get those dark ink dots on your page. What I have noticed with this set is that the chisel end is large and a little awkward to use, like you don't have as much control over your strokes. Also, the tip of the chisel gets dull/soft easily, so you have a squished point like you get when you press too hard on your marker. The other end of the marker is much better for detail work, but you do get more ink pool dots and streaks. I've posted a page from Mindware Classic Mosaics in my account so you can see how the ink lays down. I probably won't spend the money again to get these markers, I'm much happier with my Sharpies for what I do.",
    "I bought several of these hooks with hope that they would be able to support the weight of two large wreaths (approximately 10 pounds each). We had just remodeled our office and could no longer use the over the door hangers we'd been using for years. We were hesitant to use these hooks because we did not know if they would mar the new finishes in our newly remodeled office...we had no choice, so we risked it. And I am happy to tell you that two of these hooks mounted three inches apart held a holiday wreath up for five weeks on both a finely-finished, walnut plank mounted on marble and also on brick veneer mounted above a fireplace. I removed the hooks last week and they did not mar either surface...BRAVO One note, follow the install and removal instructions to the letter, they are spot-on.",

    "My Wal*Mart is no longer stocking candle making stuff, so they've put it all on clearance. This is one of the items that they had on clearance, and on a lark, we bought it. Candle making is always something I wanted to get into, but since space and money is tight in my house, this was a kind of last attempt at this particular hobby.Now, I've had this gadget for 24 hours almost, and I've made 3 candles, and I'm working on my first set of votives. This is the most user friendly candle making craft I've ever seen, and I'm infinitely glad I got this gizmo which, truly does, work as easily as the box makes it out to work. Within half an hour of getting this home, I was making candles. All you have to do is some light assembly, plug it in, and follow the instructions. Voila!This really comes with everything you need... A pound of blue wax granules, a pillar candle cast, a stopper, wicks. All you do is pour it in the hopper, turn on the heat, wait 5 minutes, stir the wax, wait another 5 minutes, and pour. About an hour later, you do a second pour to fill in the dip in the middle of the candle, then you let it set overnight. In 12 hours, you have a store-quality candle. It's really quite amazing.I was worried that it'd be impossible to get the candle out of the mold, and I was worried that cleaning the hopper would be a nightmare. Neither proved true. The candles come free of the little mold with a good rap on the countertop (if a good rap doesn't cut it, throw it in the freezer for about 30 minutes and try again... It'll slide right out), and the hopper is easily wiped clean (as long as you do it immediately after you're finished pouring... If you don't wipe it, don't sweat it, it'll still work and it won't gunk up your next candle). The only big problem I've found is, apparently, a problem for most candle makers, is a well sinks around the wick after it cools. This is easily corrected with a second pouring. With practice, you'll turn out perfect candles. :)Some tips for people who're making candles with this gizmo... if you melt too much wax and you still have some left over after your second pouring, use an empty, small, ice cube tray and fill up some of the ice cubes with the extra wax. Use those cubes of wax to make those fancy candles with the different colored squares in them. Also, if you're going to add herbs into the candles, add them directly into the mold, not the hopper. Add fragrance right before you pour. Also, expect you'll have to do re-pours, so save yourself some wax. Threading the wick can be a trick, so tie the end of the wick with dental floss and use that to pull the wick through the hole. I found it was much easier to secure the wick to the metal pick over the top of the candle, then plug the hole as opposed to plugging the hole then tying the pick (don't worry, when you get it, you'll know what I'm talking about).Anyway, if you like candlemaking, you NEED this !",

    "I love these little things. I take a large, medium and flat along with a portable Cottman watercolor kit and use them for sketching. They're under the size limit for liquids in carry-on luggage, which makes them an excellent airplane companion. I can't recommend them for really rough cold press paper though as the tips (even on the large) are so small that wear on the bristles becomes noticeable very quickly and makes it hard to get a really fine lines. I would also recommend carrying a larger brush for washes or just unscrewing the tip and dropping water directly on the page as covering a large area with the tiny tips on these things is a pain. But, they're great with a Moleskine watercolor sketchbook or a real smooth hot press. Arches 140 lb hot press might even be a bit rough once water hits it and the surface starts to get worked up.",

I have another EuroPro which is a piece of absolute crap that I can't even give away, but this one has outsewn everything, even my Heavy Duty machine by WHITE.It does all of the basics you need - such as straight and zig zag stitches and buttonholes. It comes with the essential accessories you need. It is lightweight and compact and doesn't hog space. At the time I got mine, it was available in royal blue, which makes quite the fashion statement.I recommend this to the beginner and the expert. I sew several layers of fleece in the making of teddy bears. It handles thick denim and silk with the same ease.",

    "I got this for my wife after she complained that the first 2 I got her were too thin. She LOVES this mat! Everyone in her classes keeps asking where to get one. It may not roll up as small as the others, but it is so comfortable, and has pretty good grip too.",
    "I was worried I didn't receive any shipping confirmation over a week after purchasing the \"package\". I was going to wait until the final day of the \"estimated arivial\" of the package. When the package finally came, it only included the mic and cable but no mic stand. I figured the stand was coming in a separate package, the packing slip printed and the \"comments\" said \"no mic stand\". I checked back on the online description and customer reviews and didn't see any note of \"mic and stand package but no mic stand\".I took the lost, I'll never buy from these individual sellers again.",
    "This makes my skin silky smooth. I'm 34. I've given this as a gift to my sister and to my mother. My mother is 58, and a multi-pack per day smoker(so you can imagine the shape of her skin). She was simply amazed at how soft this makes her skin feel. In addition to this product, I would highly recommend the microderm abrasion by Olay Regenerist. The two products together will make you feel as if you've spent a day at the spa, at pennies on the dollar!",
    "Now I'm not an expert because I used it once. It pulled my chain link fence together and that is why I bought it. I should've gotten (or made) a fence stretcher bar to do this job right. It did the job. The price is why I bought this model as it beat out most others on that feature. I may never need to use this thing again but if I do just a few more times it has already payed for itself. I had one job to do and didn't want to spend much so this one did the trick. It was easy to use following the included instructions. It seems a solid piece of equipment. Made in China, isn't everything?",
    "This is wonderful massage oil or just for every day use on especially dry winter skin. My skin soaks it right in and it does not ever feel greasy.",
    "It did not quite fit my bike model \"Flirt\". I have to install it on the handlebar sideway instead, but I guess it's more of the problem with the size of handle on my bike compared to others. otherwise, it's a great buy with reasonable price.",

    "I've had this brace for a year and while it's worked for me I don't believe it was worth the cost. I'm not saying it's poorly made. It is actually quite sturdy and beefy. But I've used Stanley braces that are $25.00 cheaper and they are just as good if not better. On the whole it is a quality tool just a little pricey.",
    "I was very pleased and satisfied with the price,availability of the product,the ease of ordering and the efficiency of arrival. I will continue to order from this company!!",
    "Great scent at a great price. Jovan Sex Appeal has been one of my Fall favorites for years, I've received many positive comments about this fragrance.Don't be fooled by the inexpensive price, this is a worthy purchase!",
    "I purchased the DVD version of this when it came out, and then, of course, they later brought it out in blue-ray as well. It is easily my favorite music video and I was interested in seeing and especially hearing it in the best quality I could find so I went ahead and bought the blue-ray as well. As far as the content goes, if you like Cream, or Eric Clapton, or Blues, then you will most likely love this concert. It is not flashy, no antics, dancing ,running, leaping about, just great music from some very fine musicians. Eric thanks us for waiting all these years, that the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune cut them off in their prime, and Jack chides him that this is their prime. I agree with Jack. They might not be as nimble as in their younger years, but they play with experience and emotion that more than compensates for the fading of youthful energy.I have read reviews complaining that Ginger seems a little long in tooth and not up to his former standards. While it is true that his drum solo on Toad is not the blazing tapestry of tones from yesteryear, he still rocks the kit in a way few other drummers do. Watch him on Crossroads, or Badge or Outside Woman blues, or Sunshine of your love, and watch how the whole of Albert Hall moves with him. I have heard Eric play some of these songs with various other artists for decades, and though I enjoy many of those versions, none of them hold a candle to these. Within the first few seconds it is immediately apparent that Ginger is on the drums and it is like coming home. It just sounds right. Now, about the quality of the blue-ray compared to the DVD. The video is markedly better, as one might expect. The sound is better as well, though not as much as the video. Considering that this was the best sounding music DVD in my library, any improvement on that is icing on the cake.",
    "keep the sewing to the standard, any you'll do A-Ok. Though Mac folks beware, the instruction CD comes only for the PC (you can read the content... just not the viewing order/interactive parts -- be sure to call Brother to request the Video version of the instructions... if you are mechanically inclined.. you won't too much of the instructions to get started... but it'll be helpful with the inevitable troubleshooting.",

    "This pedometer is very reliable and far better than the typical cheap pedometers available at the drug stores. It is a fully solid state device that uses a semiconductor accelerometer. The 7 day history of steps, miles , kCals are useful for keeping a log of activity.A small quibble is the clip that can result in the pedometer dislodging under some conditions. I did lose the first one I had when it fell off at the beach.",

    "My hairdresser has been using this stuff for years and every time I would ask her what it is, but then not buy it. I'm so glad I finally did. I live in Florida so I'm constantly battling humidity. My hair is prone to frizz anyway, so it makes my fly-aways that much worse. I use it for a sleek ponytail look in the summer, and any time I want to look a little more polished when I style my hair. I was concerned about the price and how fast I would go through it, but a little goes a long way and I'm sure this will last me a LONG time. It also smells amazing.",
    "I was a bit apprehensive ordering pastels online for fear they would arrive broken. Fortunately they arrived intact and on time. Good deal considering my local art store was asking more for the same set. Haven't tried them out yet, but I own a smaller set of Nupastels and they are my favorite pastels.",
    "These are for my Leupold 3x9-50 scope, and are really strong, fit perfectly. Seem strong enough that the 30-06 isn't likely to shake the scope loose, no matter what load I shoot. Wish the store locally had carried them, but got a better price on Amazon anyway!",
    "I attached this mic to my Kodak Zi8, and I recorded a concert this weekend. I didn't have the time to set the audio levels on my camera, but that was OK because it still sounded like I was recording in my garage. Great mic, just don't get the cheap rip off version",
    "Previous use of the product influenced purchase of larger selection of colors. Product is excellent. I was very impressed with the speed of delivery.",
    "Mikasa balls have always been of the highest quality with a grippy surface and not prone to bubbles when hit against hard and pointy surfaces such as the corner of a goal post. This blue and yellow version is no exception. Honestly, the blue sections (balls have always been monochromatic) are more for spectators than for players.",
    "This is a very basic, useable but limited, wire drawing tool which can be used to reduce size of wires or chains (annealed, of course). This plate, however, is simply drilled from both sides, therefore creating a taper from both sides. But the taper is not polished nor shaped at all, and the results will be rather limited and the surface very scratchy. Since I did NOT purchase this draw plate to pull wires, but to use for putting a head on when making rivets, it will be fine for that.A good quality draw plate will be well tapered and have highly polished inside surfaces where the wire will be pulled through; this one is not at all like that. But you would pay about 10 times the price for a 50 hole draw plate of that quality, and quite a bit more for hard, long wearing carbide inserts.The drawback of the carbide inserts as compared to tool steel is that carbide is so much harder that it can be fractured if struck or even if the draw plate were dropped (under the \"right\" circumstances). And carbide can only be polished using diamond powders, while tool steels can be re-polished using the standard polishing media, so small scratches can be polished out if they occur in tool steel drawing die. And I have scratched carbide drawing dies, so it can happen.The bottom line is that this draw plate may do for a starter; but you should consider something a bit better if you plan to use it for drawing wires or chains.",

    "I purchased this weight tree after being disappointed by 2 previous ones.I had hoped that this tree would live up to the expectations that come along with dropping this much money (not that it's cost-prohibitive, just that a Benjamin is a lot of money to some people, myself included), I expect quality. To say the least, this is not.I can't actually give an opinion on the assembled product. Mine arrived with missing parts; but even if it had arrived with all the parts, I'm not sure I would have been able to decipher the exploded assembly that they gave: AS THE ONLY INSTRUCTIONS FOR ASSEMBLY. Seriously, as though not receiving all the parts wasn't enough, they expect you to be able to fully assemble their product with simple, caveman instructions.It's just been headache after headache with weight trees for me; perhaps my expectations are too high. But when I can't even assemble a product, something is wrong.",
    "I bought this mainly for the good reviews and low price, but despite it's low price, it is a very decent pop filter. It came well packaged and 2 layers of mesh with about a centimeter and a half separating them. No explosives get through this. You can feel the difference by blowing on your hand without the pop filter and then blowing on your hand with the pop filter between them. I was going to go with the Musicians Gear Double Pop Filter but really there is absolutely no need for that. This works perfectly, and it ended up being cheaper than the other Musicians Gear Single Pop Filter would have been.",
    "I've used this product for years, but am having difficulty finding it in local stores. I just took the mildew off my entire stucco house with only 6 gallons and saved allot of money. If you can stand the smell, it's fun to watch the mildew fade in seconds right before your eyes.",

    "I ordered this TV stand after looking for a very long time for a stand that had the storage capacity I needed. The stand was ordered on 12/27/08, with an estimated delivery of 1/6 to 1/9/09. It wasn't even shipped until 1/6/09, and didn't arrive until 1/15/09. When I opened the box and began assembly, half the screws for the first step were missing. Also a shelf was packed damaged, as there was no damage on the box. I am now waiting for the replacement parts, which were ordered 8 days ago. This may be a lovely stand when it is assembled, but it has been nearly a month since I ordered it and I'm still waiting to see it put together. Update: 12/26/09 - Parts arrived, stand was easy to put together. However one of the doors is binding. Does not effect the look of the stand. It is a nice addition to my livingroom. Would now give it 4 stars.",

I imagine these would work well on amps as well. Good solid construction and rubber bushings that go between the metal glide and the amp, or high chair.",
    "After searching for a clarinet which would give me an instrument that I could be proud of and would not \"bust the budget\", I found the LJ Hutchen Bb Clarinet. I could hardly believe the value presented. I received it promptly and have been enjoying using it ever since. I had rented a more costly brand but this one is every bit as good and the accessories that came with it, the top quality case and supplies, are an excellent bonus. I had an incidental question or two which were answered promptly and courteously by the company customer service personnel. I will recommend the LJ Hutchen Bb Clarinet to my friends. It is an excellent value and a pleasure to own.",

    "This rack easily fits on my 1998 Jetta, almost like it was made for it. It's sturdy despite being relatively inexpensive compared with other rack systems and easily (and quickly) disassembles. Plus it looks cool.BUT...Do not buy from The Rack Warehouse. Worst customer service I've seen in a company in a long time, and honestly, that is saying something.",
    "I received this set of chips for Christmas. Although I do like the set these are NOT clay chips. If you read the description in one part they describe them as \"authentic soft clay look and texture\". However in the bullets describing the item they claim \"100% clay for a realistic Las vegas feel\". They are definitely not clay. Also the description is \"Color Breakdown: 150 White, 150 Red, 100 Green, 50 Blue, 50 Black\". My set is 150 White, 150 Red, 100 Green and 100 Orange.",

    "I have it for more than 6 months and mostly use it for practicing with the metronome. I have another tuner, which is set EADGBE, that is much easy to tune without any confusion. Although this tuner has flexibility for tuning differently, it's confusing for me because it keeps changing the chord and going left & right +/-20 or more. However, it's a bonus for using the tuner, and I don't have to bring all to the classes. For the metronome, which is my initial purpose to purchase it, it's great and have enough adjustable calibration, 13 beats, rhythms, and tempos for practices.",
    "I bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter. She loves it and I would highly recommend it to others. Right now we are just stringing whatever feels good.

    "I believe this was a fake perfume. I tried to return but had foolishly thrown away the box. Otherwise I could have.Whose fault I don't know. At least it smells pleasant enough. The vendor was very responsive in trying to resolvethis problem. I just won't use them again. I have enjoyed this fragance for years and do know what it should smell like.",
    "This lift was a lifesaver for me. Used it to set 4 stone caps on columns, and I simply could not have done this without the lift, or three helpers. The long ram hydraulic lift has way more vertical range than I expected, and the winch added a lot of fine adjustment, too. Heavy duty, good quality, appears to me more flexible than the ones I saw at Harbor Freight.",
    "It's good color, and I'll use it again, but next time I'm gonna buy it at walgreens, it's about $1 cheaper (Same brand, same color,) and I won't have to wait on shipping.",
    "My son uses this for practicing at home with his electric bass (Jazz Band) and his standup bass (Chamber Orchestra). It is solid, yet flexible in height and angle. Assembly was a breeze. This is the classic music stand in schools and is also excellent for home use. Built like a tank. Should last forever and can be passed down to the next generation of musicians in the family.",
    "I like my Shop-Vac #9254510 a 10 Gallon Wet or Dry vacuum. However I wish the ad would have told me that the unit had a 2 1/2\" hose set-up rather then a 1 1/4\". Could have saved me some $$$. Also if the unit had a drain valve on the bottom of the tank, it would have been nice!!!Thanks.",
    "While this is a very powerful vacuum it has a design defect verified by the service representative. The wheels on this vacuum - and the replacement vacuum we received - do not turn on their own. Only when you physically move them will they work. This is a wonderful product if you wish to utilize the shoulder strap and carry it. Otherwise this becomes a very recalcitrant puppy that you have to drag along and scratch your wood floors. This is best on a carpet as there is no problem dragging it. We would suggest its cousin for less money the Eureka which we understand from the service center does not have this design defect. If you opt for the professional product the service center suggested placing large heavy duty rubber bands on the wheels - which did work well. We suggest purchasing a large amount of these rubber bands as they do not last long. Happy cleaning!",
    "I bought these scooters for my children about 6 years ago. They ride them regularly and have put a lot of wear and tear on them. Not to mention leaving them outside in the rain and weather often. These have held up and have been well worth the 19.99 I got them for (on sale on Black Friday). My son is asking for a new one, only for asthetics since his has rust and the handle bar grips are breaking down from use. It still rolls and works fine. I think I will indulge this Christmas and buy another and keep this around for friends.He actually rides this more than his bike. He is 10 years old. My daughter, 11 still hops on hers too.Easily folds for quick storage.",
    "I bought this as a replacement for my Jason 25000U Vit E cream, and was very pleasantly surprised. The smell can be strong at first, but it fades quickly and I find it very fresh, reminiscent of cucumbers. The cream is full bodied, but soaks into my skin well rather than staying on the surface as a greasy coating like so many other creams do. I've only been using it a few days, but my skin doesn't feel tight or dry anymore and my fine lines are starting to plump in again. Great product!",
    "The selection and description of quantities led me to believe that I would get at least 3 times more. This is undoubtedly the smallest amount of heat shrink I,ve ever received for the amount I paid..... Very disappointed!",
    "I'll keep this short since anything I'll say has likely already been said.I play my acoustic guitar on it and it's comfortable enough that sometimes I remain seated on it for a while after I've already put away my guitar. And really, what more could you ask for? The build quality is great, I'm not at all worried of it breaking, and, of course, it comes at a great price. If you need a bench, you can't go wrong with this one.",
    "I bought these scissors over 15 years ago at a craft store and remember being annoyed at paying $20 for them! They have paid for themselves over and over again though the years. I am only replacing them now as they have become dull and sticky after years of rough wear and tear. The handle is very confortable. I have had good experiences with Mundial knives and scissors.",
    "Lovely Fragrance that I always get compliments on. Be prepared for a pump that gives very little with each pump so you need 15-20 pumps for a shower.",
    "So far this has been the best straightener that I have ever used. It heats up fast and you only have to run it through your har one time. I can now straighten my hair in just minutes. It gets extra hot. You have a power on button and a turbo power on button and with that it gets turbo hot! The removeable comb in awesome!! I love to use it because it saves time without being annoying like some products with extra features. It is easy to remove by sliding out but stays in place when put back on, it is also easy to put back on. This has been the hottest straightener that I have ever used. I love Conair styling products. I have no bad things to say about this wonderful product. The only thing that can be a small con is that sometimes I have to hit the power on button 2-3 times to get it to turn on, which is easy to tell because the light comes right on. Other then that, this item is simple to use and works very well and heats up wonderfully which saves time. The Amazon price is about $5 bucks less then Walmart's price where I got mine and this straightener was money well spent. It cost a little less then straighteners that do not work as well. Conair products are known to work great and last a long time!! With the removeable comb and all the features this deserves 5 STARS! Usually you will get a straightener that does not have the removeable comb or turbo on putton and there are also 25 heat settings, it is simple to use and works great!",
    "With the winter approaching, I knew I needed something to seal those drafts around the window. I didn't want to cover them with plastic insulation as it doesn't look nice. I decided to try this instead. I was so impressed with the ease of use. went around several windows where I felt drafts. No more drafts and it isn't even noticeable.",
    "I bought these for my husband and he likes them. They are a lot cheaper than at local sporting goods store chains where he previously purchased them. Being a big & tall man he'd like them to be a little longer but they are decent in that regard. He has a strong sensitivity to fabrics that are not 100% cotton. We've bought three shirts so far and waiting on two more.Colors that are 100% cotton:1. Black2. Royal BlueColors that are not 100% cotton:1.

    "I was so intimidated when I received this, I let it sit for a whole weekend before I tried it. I didn't need to be worried. It is easy to operate and I am thrilled with the two &#34;infinity dresses&#34; I made. These infinity dresses were made without a pattern, and I am just a beginner at sewing. The four thread stitch still allows plenty of stretch to my spandex fabrics and made these two dresses total successes.I was really worried about threading the machine. The good news is there are lots of good instructional videos on YouTube. (The videos that come with the machine are old, out-dated, and only run on Windows computers. They are worth a quick look, but the YouTube videos are much better.) Even better, it comes with four reels of thread already in place. This was enough to make both dresses. The best tip: when you almost run out of one thread, tie a new thread onto the end and let it run right through the machine. Works right up until you get to the two needles. The other two threads have no needle eyes or problems.If you are a beginner, like me, I think this machine will help you with those stretchy fabrics.",
    "We put these strings on my daughter's cello that had cheap stock strings, and were surprised at the huge improvement in tone. Very clear and bright--probably too bright for an advanced player, but good for the student players that these strings are designed for. Unless you have absolutely zero budget for your instrument, upgrading from cheap strings to these ones is money well spent.",

    "I stitched this as a gift for my mother who is a seascape artist, oils. She gets compliments from people thinking she painted it. I have moved out of state and miss it so much I am going to stitch another for myself.The kit is very involved and tedious due to all the colors and the aida cloth count, size 18, but so totally worth it. It took me two years to complete the kit.I framed it in a wooden frame for my mother but for myself I will see about a metal frame as that is what I like.You will not be disappointed in this kit.Happy stitching.",

    "This flute is extremely good for the price and makes a fine starter flute. It's not good enough for playing in college, but fine for the middle school beginner and high school student up to a certain level of playing. I checked with some flute players & teachers before purchasing, and this make was recommended over several others (it's not better than a Yamaha starter flute, but it's more affordable.) In particular, the price is helpful for children who may not always treat their instrument with the care it needs at first. My child didn't realize how delicate the flute is, and once dented it as a result (it's been repaired) so I'm especially glad I didn't buy something more expensive. We are happy with it and I would buy another of these if any of my other children choose to take up the flute.",
    "While I have no doubt that this gadget also works well for punching holes in leather belts, I used it to punch an extra hole in my shoe buckle strap. Worked perfectly. It also works well for punching holes in anything less sturdy than leather. Works equally well for cloth and some thin plastic. I'm pleased.",
    "Some have commented on the smell of the case, we did find it to be there in ours. The guitar itself is very nice well made and sounds great. The guitar is worth the price so if you don't like the case smell then get something else. The case design is very nice and we hope that in time the smell will go away. All in all a very good value.",
    "Have used the gloves about three times in the yard, cutting and pulling pines and shrubs. Gloves worked great. Some of the growth hard thorns like rasberry bushes and I was able to grab and pull out by the root without and problems. Also made it easy to get a good grip allowing me to pull out by the root more than just cut at the root.",
    "I bought this as a gift for my husband who always wanted to to learn to play but never really got around to it. I did a lot of research and found this as the most complete pakage to have for the price that is just unbeatable! The guitar is beautiful in black, and it includes everything you could ever need to play a tune - the picks, a digital tuner, a bag to be able to carry it around and protect the guitar, and extra strings for replacement. I recommend you get the Mel Bay books if you plan to either learn or review...my husband has learned so much since Christmas it is quite amazing. Great buy.",
    "This board acts like a cross between watercolor paper and an etch-a-sketch. Using just water, your brush strokes go on and quickly appear as dark lines on the board, but as the water dries the lines fade to shades of grey and then disappear completely. Unlike real brush and ink, this never gets messy, as it is only water. It's wonderful to practice brushwork for caligraphy or drawing, but becomes its own separate art form due to the added element of the drying times. (Which part of the drawing will disappear first? Which parts become shadows instead of lines?) We left ours out and set up for a week after we got it, and found ourselves casually stopping to paint an image. It is relaxing and enjoyable for any age.",
    "On a recent trip, my carry-on size lotion had spoiled or something gross and my host had this lotion to offer. After a week of use, my skin was less dry and much smoother/softer, so I bought it as soon as I got home. As other reviewers have noted on the larger size, the lotion itself isn't super thick like a body butter would be, but it does not spread as easily as you might expect a lotion of this consistency to spread. However, it does absorb pretty quickly and I find that if I towel off the excess that didn't soak in I get good coverage and a clean feel (plus I've been told you should always towel off excess face and body lotion and I live in the south and its real humid here). Unlike most other lotions I've tried, this lotion keeps my skin moisturized for probably 36-48 hours.This lotion exfoliates!! The alpha hydroxy in this lotion really really really works [for me] for removing that layer of dead cells that makes skin feel rougher and duller. I've noticed my skin feels and looks smoother. Another testament to this power is the apparent popularity of this lotion within the follicular keratosis community. And though I'm a bit shy about it, its helped alleviate some folliculitis on my backside. So if you have problems with ingrown hairs or have folliculitis from excess dead skin cells (for me manual exfoliation just has never seemed to cut it), this lotion is a really good option. The bottle notes that its a good lotion for dry skin associated with diabetes, but I can't speak to that.Also, it doesn't have much of a scent at all.If you were concerned, this is the same as the larger item (http://www.amazon.com/Eucerin-Lotion-Intensive-16-9-Ounce-Bottles/dp/B001FB5IRS/ref=pd_sim_sbs_bt_1). Both sizes have recently changed their packaging, but the lotion is the same.TLDR: long-lasting, unscented, really really helps exfoliate skin, prevents folliculitis and ingrown hairs",
    "You might think finding a double-pully would be easy with Lowes, Home Depot and a host of smaller hardware stores in/around Philadelphia. It isn't.The company shipped the pullies rather quickly, with normal shipping.This item has a 400lb capacity and works really well for block and tackle configurations (you'll obviously need 2 or more to set up a block and tackle). I used these pullies to hang boats/kayaks from the ceiling of my garage. The pullies are well constructed, rugged and have lubricated bearings.",
    "Great quality sandpaper, the paper backing holds up well, when you flex or fold the sandpaper it doesn't crack or tear easily. I buy in 50 bulk packs to save money.",
    "I have given up on all other countersink bits besides the three-cutter Wolfcraft jobs with the tapered pilot bit (shown here). Used separately as a pilot, or in combination with the countersink, these are precise, don't \"walk\", stay sharp, and the countersink part is easily re-sharpened with a stone for added mileage. Great tool at a great price.",
    "Bought these considering Nicholson a quality American made product - Received them and they are made in China. As I will be using these professionally, we'll see how they hold up. Can't give them a bad rating just made in China alone, but if quality falters - I will adjust accordingly!",
    "The product is exactly what we were looking for. We needed some inner tubes for my sons wheelchair an these worked perfectly for the job. I would recommend this product and the price was great.",
    "I love Penny Lane. Oh my I love it. I'm fair skinned and I put this on my apples and orgasm on my cheek bones (round face, so I have both). LOVE.",
    "We have 14 affordable housing apartments sites and our maintenance men are constantly moving large and applicances and furniture. These straps have not only made their jobs easier they have cut down on back strain and employees out of work",
    "Great serger for a great price. Just like what most of the reviews on this machine,,, wonderful.I was very cautious, because of all the threading combinations. But, Brother did something that was so useful in having the machine prethreaded and ready to go. It took all the scariness away. The videos were very helpful, The book was also helpful.I was up and running in minutes. I have had the machine for three weeks now. I completely rethreaded several times with different colored threads, no problems.Just serging away... having fun.",
    "Waited a year and half to review this vacuum cleaner.Works well enough for stairs and cars. There are better units out there.",
    "First of all, let's talk about the noise level on this thing. YIKES! That should be against some kind of consumer protection law. The blowdryer part is ok, but didn't like the brushes at all. I'll go back to my Conair stying brush and my straightener.Live and learn.",
    "Perfect fit and easy to install. Really helped at the range. Actually stoppen the musel flip proble I had and it was easier on the hand. Great product. I ordered another set for another firearm.",
    "After reading several reviews I went with this rack. A lot of racks got lousy reviews because they were loose and rattled in the reciever. This one arrived promptly, was easy to assemble, and easy to use. It doesn't rattle, seems very secure in the rack, and has done well on the couple of trips I've used it on so far. The tilt-down feature makes it easy to open the rear hatch on our SUV without removing the rack.",
    "I bought this mat so that I do more with my scrapbooking and it sure is great!! It really is self-healing. I've used it several times and it still looks like new! Thank you!",
    "I keep this on my bed table. I like to get in bed at night and put this on my hands and feet.",
    "This is a very limited device. As such, I haven't had any problems with it, but its limitations have proven too much for me. Without being able to attach headphones and monitor my input, I really can't use it unfortunately. I imagine under more controlled settings than I usually work in, you could figure out exactly where your vu meters have to be in order to get a good sound into this device, so I think this would probably be good for recording at home, where you can leave it plugged in and set to the same levels.I am right now using it to record from a cassette to mp3, and plugged into my stereo tape deck, I can imagine using it like this a lot. I have not been able to attach it to a hard drive, so I have only used it with a usb2 compact flash reader and a 1gb card, and generally successfully. But again, the only way to know if you are really getting the sound right is to stop recording, remove the card or whatever, and plug it into something that does play it, like a computer. And I have one next to my stereo, so I can do that if I want.For field recording I have found this to be too much of an impediment. I am however enthused about trying the ikey plus, as soon as it is available at your usual online retailers like Amazon here (Just released apparently, and has a mic input and a headphone out.) I will probably sell this one as soon as I can get the plus model.********************************This added much later. I have since sold it and gotten the iKey Plus, and am very pleased with it, at least for the few times I have used it. Not only does the iKey Plus add several key functionalities, but improves on the ones already present. But the absolutely crucial feature of being able to monitor your input is what really made the difference. I'll probably give the Plus model a favorable review in a few more weeks, unless I encounter some major glitch.",
    "I have not used this product, as yet, but it seems to be \"as advertised\" and will effectively protect ties during travel.",
    "I put this stuff on my Panther Tattoo, made it look like a Salamander. What's Yer Problem? Whatever.",
    "I bought this book to be an on-the-shelf reference (it is definitely too heavy to be a field guide, and is not meant to be), but now I would buy it just for the beauty of the drawings. They are fantastic. I think any person at least mildly interested in nature would like it just for the beauty and details of the drawings.Apart from that, together with the &quot;Guide to Bird Behavior&quot; it will also do everything you could possibly expect from a birding reference book.",
    "These are basic, Made-in-China Forstner Bits. I agree with the others: they do the job...not great, but certainly serviceable, especially at today's price of ~$15.I have uploaded a few photos since there were none before. Worth noting:Pros: a nice plastic case and assortment of sizesCon: the low quality of manufacturing [see pitted cutting surface]Overall rating: a decent buy for general use...not for the high-end work, though.",
    "This past weekend, I finished a painting I had been working on for a week that included markers as well as acrylic paint. I took the project outside to spray, and the markers ran all over the painting. I am starting again tonight with the painting! Very sad. The markers were permanent, and it says on the can that this does not smear...liars!!! ;) Just thought I'd give a heads up!Other than that, it is a great product, :)",
    "I am new to welding and checked the previous reviews about these gloves. All I know is during my practice welding session I was holding a piece of flat iron in my hands for quite some time and then set it down. I looked and noticed it was glowing red (I was not holding it at the red portion but just below it). I felt NO heat in my hand. These gloves are durable and protect your hands amazingly well.Pros:+ comfortable+ fits mid size to large hands well+ quality construction+ made in the USACons: (minor)- color comes off easily on the finger tips with alot of use.Overall these gloves are perfect for your welding jobs.Thanks for reading my review.",
    "My wife wanted a disco at our house so I did my research on Amazon and bought a few items. This was fantastic. It puts out a lot of smoke, although I had to go back and do it again every 5 mins or so. The next day I found that some of the juice had leaked out, so next time I'll put it on a tray. I bought a large gallon jug of spare juice, but in the end the bottle that comes with this was more than enough for two evenings of dancing.",
    "I just got my tri lite folding chair in the mail. IT'S INCREDIBLEI can hardly believe how light it is and easy to assemble.and it works.my hats off to whoever I designed it .Jane",
    "This pair of heavy duty nets was defiitely built to last. The material is very durable and the nets are thick enough to withold the punishment that good shooters can put it through. Mine have been outdors, exposed to the elements (sun and rain), for over six months and have shown no signs thay are ever going to shread, as reported with theSpalding 8279S All-Weather Basketball Net (Red/White/Blue).On the negative side, I'm not sure they properly check the ball after each successful attempt. They do the job, but not as well as I have experienced from other nets. Perhaps this is due to the length, because as other reviewer commented, they are not as long as regulation nets. But for non-regulation/recreational basketball I don't think you can get any better.",
    "Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it) I needed to use this brand-new plunger the very day I received it. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it plunged, as my old one required a lot of muscle to operate. After the plunger had done its job, I was really appreciative of the self-opening and closing storage pod. No muss, no fuss...just how I like it!!",
    "The cable is good, and does it's job. The next day after ordering it, I dropped by The Guitar Center, and purchased a cable that is guaranteed for life, works just as well, and is 1/2 the price...",
    "We bought this product, and kind of wish we hadn't. The light is not very helpful for my husband - we are going to install a light in the ceiling fan, and think it will be much better. Also, the battery that it came with didn't work....it just isn't a great product - I would rather pay more for something that works.",
    "I listened to the other reviews and ordered large size instead of my normal medium... Glad I did! Large fits me great, and these gloves feel right. Not too bulky, but sturdy and flexible."
